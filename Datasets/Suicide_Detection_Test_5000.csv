198371,"Just some rants...I would not say that I currently am suicidal, though the thoughts linger, that is something that I'll admit. I have attempted to strangle myself twice already, but I had reassured myself that things would get better before it. But right now, I'm at my wits end, things are going sour everywhere, and I just feel helpless and alone; in a way, like many people in this subreddit.

I'll post some details. My main issue comes from my ""friends."" These are people I would hang out with, and yet there's no connections, nothing realistic to bind us together. I always feel like the odd man out; rather I know. I was gone for a week and nobody noticed, except for a few individuals. In honesty all I want is one friend that I can rely on no matter what; just one real friend that would always be there for me, and yet here I am, alone. It always bothers me how I'll always ask how their day was on Steam or text them if they need anything, and nobody will say anything to me. I'll be on Steam all day, and not a single damn message. Not a single one. I have to be the guy that messages people, I'm the guy that listens to their shit, I'm the guy always their, and when its my turn to get help, their backs are turned, they're ""busy"", they're this and that and this and that and this and that. I just don't find it that fair. 

And yet at the same time, I've been fighting with the idea that life truly is meaningless. It just seems that we're always striving for something better, a better job, etc, and yet there isn't really a point. In the end, we're all going to die, our endeavors forgotten, and our names to be lost in the wind. It just doesn't seem fair for me to go out and get shit on, only to get nothing in the end. 

I don't know, I just needed to rant, though those are just the big issues. I might be a bit scatter brained right now, but thanks in advance. Love you guys for your awesome work, and I can only float on right? But basically I'm asking myself, why shouldn't I just point the gun in my head and end it now?",suicide
198373,"""You should be in the hospital"" yeah I'm still paying for the last time and that was 3 years ago, no fucking thanksIf you're gonna charge me almost $10,000 to survive then let me die in peace Jesus Christ. Last hospital visit when I was gonna kill myself just about ruined me financially so fuck that noise. Especially when a big part of why I'm suicidal in the first place is debt. So tell me how taking on more debt would be a good idea?

198407,"I am unloved, unaccepted, undesirableI got nothing to lose posting here.

I joined 15 dating sites and frequent them frequently each and every day since February of this year.

I went on one date out of all of them and it didn't end in a way that made sense to me.


I must have tried speaking to hundreds of girls and almost never ever get a reply back probably because I am unattractive.
No matter how polite and funny I try be on these sites I am never worth a response, I am not obligated a response I keep telling myself, but the fact I don't even get a first look makes me feel less than human.

I am a virgin, only had my first date at 20 and that is it, I keep thinking of this, like as a creature put on this earth I will never experience a natural act that creatures do, that I will remain untouched, unloved, undesirable in every sense of the word.

Every day just feels the same coming home and doing the same routine all alone.

I want sex okay? I desperately want to experience the touch of a girl close to me, it validates me as a person.

I can't even do that because I am ugly, and pale, and skinny and stupid.
I don't know why I can't even get responses back, I am not nasty I just am bitter from being unloved.

198424,"Broke up before we even started So I met this girl on the ski team. It was her first year skiing and she was really bad so I though she was like a nerd or something. So I kinda avoided her. I usually ride the lift back up by myself but, she joined me and after a nervous couple of seconds she broke the silence and started talking. I instantly new that I could keep talking to her until her ear fell off. So I started trying to sit with her on chairlifts more often.

The end of the season approaches and I think off asking her out. Of course I get to nervous and chicken out. Lucky for me she didn’t 😺 out. Since it was the first time a not complete weirdo said they liked me I thought for awhile if I should say yes. Luckily she texted me so I just quickly typed yes and hoped I didn’t just make my life terrible.

She asks me where I want to go and I say a pizza place. She agrees and we set up to meet in four days.

The day finally comes around and I am so frickin nervous. I spend half the day thinking the whole thing was a prank and that she’s not going to shows up.

I bike there and I get there before her. She’s wearin the normal baggy unzipped sweatshirt with the ripped jeans. We walk inside to get our pizzas and I see she just gets a cheese pizza. We walk outside and she noticed that I didn’t have any cheese on mine (I don’t like chees I don’t know why) I tell why. Then she tell me that she’s vegetarian soo I’m like wrong restaurant pick in my end.

We spend like 4 hours just talking and I think she looked like she was having fun. I know I was having fun, but it was staring to get cold so I say that I should probably leave soon since I didn’t have a coat. She’s like okay. We talk for like 40 more minutes then we both leave.

Cut to a week later I ask her if she wants to go on a date. (We had a break so that why theirs a gap) she takes like 2 days to respond when she does she says that she confused why I texted her again because she thought I didn’t look like I was having fun on the date. I’m completely dumbfounded that she thought that but I just said alright bye. And that the last time we talked.

198427,"i don't ever want to live in this world as an adultOof. This is probably the most honest I'm ever going to be, and somewhat of a rant, so I'm sorry. I just need to get it all out.

I had a somewhat normal childhood. My dad was always an angry man, though that subsided eventually, and stuff was okay. We eventually moved out of our apartment into a small town, and then everything went bad. I have always been incredibly shy, but even by 3rd grade I had full-fledged social anxiety and extreme dysphoria. (I'm trans--didn't know it then, but I felt constant discomfort and anxiety about my appearance and my name and everything. Figuring it out hasn't helped much.)

They told me I was advanced for my age, and it got to my head. I was an asshole all the way up until middle school, when it amplified because my mom ended up an abusive, cheating alcoholic and my dad a raging cynic. It's so typical, but hey, it fucking sucks. I made a great friend that I outright emotionally abused for a year--she should have stopped talking to me. We have a wonderful, healthy aquaintance-ship now, (we don't talk about anything but we do write together sometimes.) but anyway I'm overwhelmed by guilt from that. She's smart and wonderful and I'm definitely jealous of her, but not in a bad way. She's just everything I wish I had lived up to be.

In middle school I tried to kill myself for the first time, and failed. After I got out of the hospital I couldn't go back for a month because of paperwork issues. I was given a 504 plan (I think that's what they're called--might be wrong on the number) but it didn't help at all. I went to a magnet school, had an AMAZING freshman year despite stuff getting worse between my mom and dad--that included watching my mom attempt suicide in front of me--and severe health issues developing. 

I did still attempt in spring that year, and was out for two whole months in inpatient. I ran away that fall, in my sophomore year, because I was being forced to go back to my town's school--full of kids who harassed me and humiliated me time and time again. I came back and tried to off myself once again. I went back, had a hell of a time in a special education room they put kids with ANY behavioral problems in (read: kids with anxiety, insecurities, etc were placed with kids that harassed, assaulted and made fun of other kids. good times, good times) tried to end it AGAIN. I sucked at it, I know.

I skipped a year of high school because they didn't have sped study halls and I had extra credits from my magnet school, so yay, graduated at 16. Everyone thinks I'm some kind of genius when I'm actually an idiot that can't even do basic math or read because of cognitive difficulties. I went to college last fall, had a breakdown because I couldn't retain any of the lessons and couldn't handle being around people and came home--2,000 dollar mistake! yay. hopefully my life insurance will at least cover that.

Got a shitty fast food job and guess what--I broke down again! I mess up literally everything I try!!! I get overwhelmed and just have anxiety attacks constantly. It's worse because I get bouts where I really want to try and get a job and be on my own, but I can't. Before my dad was able to drive me to work (I don't have a car or license) but now he can't and my mom isn't reliable. Can't get a job without a car, can't get a car without a job. To be fair, most of my breakdown was because they didn't pay me and made me work extra hours that I wasn't paid for either. So.

Now? I tried and tried. I tried life and made things for other people harder because of it. I'm a waste, I'm incapable, I deserve no chances. I feel like a terminally ill patient that's holding on to the last clutches of life. I should never have existed. I can't even hold a fast food job. 

Before, at least I felt guilty about leaving my dad behind. But now he has a girlfriend and my brother so it'll be okay if I'm dead. My mom doesn't care. I have no friends at all. I'm a little bit bummed that I never got my first kiss and am dying a virgin, but I probably would have anyway. I can't imagine making someone put up with me. I'm fucking terrible.

In addition to all this, I'm in constant physical pain. I have interstitial cystitis, which for me is very severe. It's like a UTI but worse and can't go away. I have a lot of other physical issues as well, one of which is me LITERALLY BEING ALLERGIC TO MYSELF. What are the fucking chances. Thanks, chronic urticaria. Love those constant allergies that won't go away!!! &lt;:)

I am going to therapy--have tried several therapists--and am medicated, tried many medications. I don't even know which one I'm on atm. I just pop one in every morning, even though it does fucking nothing. I've had therapists say they think I'm on the autistic spectrum before, but I don't even give a shit anymore. I'm just too messed up to make it. I don't get the point of it all, anyway. I can't get a job or hold one even if I did, so I'll never get a house or anything. I definitely couldn't date anyone. I don't want to drag anyone down with me.

I could rant about so many more things... I guess the only other reason I have is that my whole life has been dedicated to art. I really wanted to be an illustrator, but everybody else my age is far ahead of where I am. I have no hopes of making it to a decent art school. They unfortunately didn't have art classes for sped students at my school. It's a shame I'm too stupid to do science because I also love geology and exploration (would love to do some kind of urban exploration or ancient exploration, but lol.)

Sorry this is ramble-y. I just wanted to get some stuff out, in the hopes someone out of the situation could just...know that I exist. I wanted to be seen.

I'm gonna hold it out through the summer, since my cat will probably pass away soon and I want to be with him. Thankfully my birthday is right at the end of summer and I can just do it while my dad's at work. It makes me so happy to know he won't have to deal with me anymore...every time we argue now  it doesn't hurt me as much. Because he only has to do it so much longer.

I'm a junior in high school, and I hate absolutely everything about myself. to the world, I'm an honor student that's involved in just about everything, but I don't think I amount to anything. I'm no honor student; I currently have a D and an F and my parents are doing everything they can to make sure I remember it. I would try to fix it but the fact of the matter is when I do start to study, I get so unmotivated because deep down I just know I won't get better. it doesn't help that every time I do badly, I am told that I'll just go to community college. all my friends are exceedingly smart, and they think I am too when really I'm just a dumb piece of shit. 

another thing: I've started playing league of legends recently. I've had so much fun with it, but I'm absolute shit at that too. every game I play awfully and every game I'm flamed and told to kill myself, and when I respond saying that I really do think of it they never believe it, of course. 

that leads me into my next point: I think I'm a sensitive little shit that cares too much about everything and I let everything hurt me.  I can't take the slightest bit of criticism or any negative comments because of the way I've been built up over the years, and I just cry over everything. I don't just cry over everything, I also bottle everything up. I've never told anyone any of this because I know I'm just a burden to everyone and I don't want to bother anyone. 

also, I don't know if I have depression. according to the symptoms I do, but I haven't gone to someone that could diagnose me officially. I desperately want to go, but my parents would likely say that I'm just being ridiculous and that I'm overreacting. 

also, I'm sincerely very sorry. my situation isn't really much of a situation at all, and when I look at other posts on here I realize that I'm just a pathetic crybaby that has no real issues.

198445,"The ubiquitous college dilemmaI apologize for the grammatical headache this post is, but I am at a loss.

We all know that college kids kill them selves left and right these days, and I'm in line to be one of them.

As the firstborn son of an Asian mother, I'd always had high expectations placed upon myself. My grades have always been stellar, and now I'm in med school, plugging away and digging myself deeper into that debt abyss. 

To further complicate things, I've had a hidden chronic depression for many years. No one knows about it save for an ex-fiancé that left a few years back (and I'd be lying if I said that her abrupt and unannounced departure wouldn't haunt me for years afterward), and though my parents had caught me cutting in high school, they did not receive it kindly. They see things like anxiety as trivial and selfish despite their careers in medicine. In 2012, I began my trek through college with a medical degree in mind along with a fresh, shiny Honors Program Scholarship that paid my first degree off completely save for the books. My will was strong the first two years of maintaining the mandatory 4.00 GPA, though I'd flinched a few times, falling into deep depressions and losing my hair faster. I'd been studying 12 hours a day and getting little sleep, but life was still fresh and exciting. Fast forward into medical school, and that fire is gone; I'm tired of it mentally and physically. The costs are so immense: tens of thousands a year along with nearly a thousand to even park remotely close to the university premises. I don't like my degree. I spent so much... lost my hair, bouts of extreme anxiety as suicidal ideation, and fucktons of money to get to where I am, and I don't like any of it. I hate medschool, and hate doctors: I know many of them and half are fucked up in the head, the other half all incredulous douchebags. I'm running myself broke and live with my folks again, who would still destroy me if I'd quit on my degree that I couldn't stand a single semester more of and destroy me if I told them I wasn't happy. So for more nearly a decade, I've delved into escapism to get my mind off of things- and I do it more and more only to find it working less and less. The past few weeks have been particularly filled with suicidal thoughts... weddings, birthdays, car trouble, tuition, hour cuts at work, etc, have all been pushing back against me, forcing me into a corner. I feel ashamed; I spend so much on my escapism as well: video games, books, manga, and analog games. Never have I thought that my death would be of natural causes, and I'm so, so tired of pushing toward a lifetime of debt for a degree I don't want, letting my body fall apart in stress, deal with waves of such heavy anxiety and depression rolling in and out. My grades are suffering now that I've been relying on escapism to stay sane, and this, every time I think about it- pushes me to an edge. 

I don't know why I posted here. It's one of the only things I'd ever done on my Reddit account, and a last bastion- looking for something that I don't know even though I'm hard-headed and sure of how this will end up, and as it would seem, I'm not good with stress. I'll likely end up as a college suicide rate statistic soon.",suicide

So, on Thursday at school, I was walking back to my desk at the back of the classroom when my crush called me to come to her desk, I walked there and asked her if she needed help with something, she then just straight up says: can I borrow your jacket?
So I kinda just looked at her and said “ok” without questioning it, so I lend  her my jacket I was wearing and as I was walking back she said: haha! I’ve stolen inverse pie’s jacket. I twist around and look at her, she has put on the jacket and you have no idea how fucking adorable she looked, she looked at me and said “why is your jacket so big?”
I just told her: I thought you knew I was tall. She held on to it until the end of the school day and gave it back to me

And now it's my exams. In 8 days, I have my first exam, and my brain already decided i will fail it. And the big exam at the end of the month. Yup will probably fail that too.

I felt like after any given moment something will bad happen so I was constantly on fight or flight mode. 

so my little smart brain though that cutting myself will make me feel the same as I did before so I cut. I feel a bit more like I used to feel like but not exactly. it's more like feeling numb rn.

I've struggled with depression my entire life. Not the ""can't get out of bed, low energy"" kind of depression but the ""I just ran up a mountain and I should feel good but all I want to do is jump off"" type. My highs are \*always\* followed by even deeper lows. I've tried meds, several kinds and dosages. Meds are like Lake Missoula for me; they hold a lot of stuff back but eventually it breaks and all the growth is wiped out.

Um, don't do that? First off, no one with half a brain is going to tell you that fat is beautiful or healthy or whatever the fuck you want to complain about.

She doesn’t have any current plan but has attempted once before. She has a therapist and other friends and family. From our conversations, it seems like she wants to feel less depressed, but is not particularly motivated to plan for safety or recognize when she is spiraling. She does not use the safety plan that her therapist and she worked on. How can I help her? Is it pushy to keep asking her to refer to her plan every time she tells me about her thoughts?

198565,"Should I commit suicide?Hey everyone. I want your honest opinions- I'm honestly not looking for any particular answer, but to know what to do. I genuinely don't know whether or not I should stay alive and the decision is really hard to make. I'm 20 y/o, took SSRIs when I was 16-17 for 16 months for social anxiety, had a pretty good life besides experiencing some (mainly social) anxiety prior to taking the pills. While on zoloft, I felt extremely depersonalized, emotionally numb, apathetic, and irritable 24/7. I decided to come off the pills in August 2016 and then about 2 months later crashed into the worst anxiety and emotional suffering I could ever even imagine let alone describe. Basically: it was internal torture, extreme restless agony, I simply could not exist in that pain. I blame it 100% on zoloft withdrawal, since I had never felt even nearly that bad before taking that. To top it off, I developed PSSD (post-SSRI sexual dysfunction) after coming off zoloft, basically meaning I can't feel attraction to anyone of the opposite sex or anyone at all, my genitals are numb, my emotions and lust for life are gone, and sexual activity feels as exciting as watching grass grow. Now, I also have post-SSRI anhedonia too, and the more numb my genitals are, the more numb I am to worldly pleasures- beautiful music, friends, movies, rollercoasters, you name it. SSRIs caused probably permanent anhedonia and sexual dysfunction for me. It's been 31 months since I came off the pills.  


Now, this all seems really bad, and I really wanted to end my life and have contemplated it for a long time. But I'm only 20, and I'm almost certain that in about 4-8 years, a cure will be developed for this condition by the name of CT38, which would upregulate 5-ht1a, which is probably the receptor that caused this whole problem. (All PSSD sufferers who don't believe this will cure us, just don't say anything, I'm not interested.) Also, I believe that stem cell therapy might be able to reverse this brain damage, but that is a long ways away before it becomes affordable. Again, probably 4-8 years.  


So I'm wondering. I've already lost 4 years of my life due to this shit. 4 years of my youth that I'm never getting back. Do I wait another 4-8 years and waste more of my youth, or should I wait and get cured in 4-8 years, with 8-12 years of my life wasted, and life the rest of my life?  


This is my main problem, and this anhedonia is unbearable. It's really hard to live in this state. I'm genuinely wondering what you would do. I'm leaning toward ending my life now before I waste more of my youth. Please don't try to be heroes, I only want your honest opinions.  


TLDR: I'm 20 and took SSRIs and developed PSSD and anhedonia that will probably be gone in 4-8 years if I wait, but I don't want to lose my youth. What do I do?

My life is very, very slowly falling apart. My teeth are falling apart and, right now, I have medicaid so I get by. My state's coverage is insanely good so I even got a partial denture.

Thing is, I really love sex. As is, with a full bright smile, I'm on that borderline between totally unfuckable and able to be charming enough to have a sporadic girlfriend or two. I'm a genuinely nice guy to them ( not to be confused with a Nice Guy ) and every relationship I've gotten into I've taken seriously and given my all, it just doesn't always work out and it's hard for me to find the next girl who is attracted to me. Such is the story and, if that were all, I could live this way. Maybe be alone half the time and with someone half the time. Doable. I don't have to be Heff to be happy.

However, I have another tooth that clearly has something wrong with it. Now this one can be given up if I must, and my state's medicaid will put it right into my partial. I'm already missing 4 and have managed to date and have romantic relationships, so I'm sure missing 5 won't be too life changing.

However, the decay rate indicates that I'm going to have upper full plate dentures sooner rather than later. The hybrid-implant would really be the proper solution, but there's no way I can afford it even in Mexico or something... So I'll have grandpa dentures in my upper palate before I turn 40. And a nice little couple years of completely disgusting teeth as I decline, I'm sure.

I'm tough as hell. I've been lonely before. I've lost hundred and hundreds of pounds and even my body being covered in stretch marks/sagging hasn't kept me from dating. I've been so far down in the hole, so depressed and ""out"" that I think only felons, victims of abuse, cops/soldiers, and people who have been homeless have gone through more.

But this indignity, losing my teeth! It's going to make dating almost impossible, and I don't want to fly solo for decades and decades! I didn't even really start getting laid/dating until I was over 30, I did my time alone, I won't go back.

If I can't find a satisfactory way to move forward with these dental issues, I just can't go on. I was already the 600lb freak who hid in the basement and I beat that rap, I'm sure as hell not going to be ""that guy with the yellow teeth"" or ""grandpa wooden teeth.""

-""There are people who have worse problems""

-""Focus on the positives in your life"" 

-""I know how you feel"" (unless you were suicidal too and you explicitly told him) 

-""You're going to hell for that""

What do you think about it?"") 

-""Stay strong""


**What to say (must be an every day thing or almost):**

-""How are you doing today?"" (keep them busy and make them not to think of their depression and suicidal thoughts) 

-""Is there anything I can do for you?"" 

-""I'm here if you wanna talk"" 

-""Can I ask you why are you depressed?"" - ""Wanna talk about it?"" 

-""Are you thinking about ending your life?"" if they say yes, ask ""Do you have a plan for how you would do it?"" if they say yes again, ask ""Have you thought about when you would end your life?""

I'm fucking tired of being that the only one person that is afraid of everyone and doesn't know how to communicate with anyone.

I feel too jealous about others for being too socially active and talkative unlike me. 
My grades are now also really becoming worse and worse each day, and I am sure that I'll fail my exams at all. Another reason for me to kill myself.

I have almost no friends, I have only 4 friends, and 2 even ignore me because even they know that I'm just a very, very terrible person to talk with. I told them that I am getting better at talking with others and being less anxious, they told me that I am just lying only to myself, and guess they're right. Almost each time I said that, my anxiety only was getting back much worse. 

I've been feeling socially anxious since I was 13, made me way too depressed almost every day and even suicidal because this shit just got way too far from fine, especially after being bullied at school for a long time by classmates. 

I am alone everywhere, school, home, etc... 

No-one wants to hang around with me outside anymore, no matter what. All of my classmates never gave a fuck about me at all.

And I'll have to head home with my forged transcript of A- grades (and a few Bs to make it realistic). The thought of my family finding out gives me panic attacks and I can't breathe and eventually collapse. I can't continue this cycle any longer. Don't tell me to talk with my parents, there is literally nothing i wouldn't rather do. Compared to that, killing myself is a piece of cake. I don't care that they'd rather hear it from me, let them find it out along with my dead body. I ruined my life and I'm too much of a coward to face the mess I made.",suicide

My university treats me like a criminal because I have borderline personality disorder and they're convinced I'm going to hurt someone. I can't get out of bed anymore, there's no use. I want to die with everything in my being, but it's eclipsed by my wish to make other people happy. I don't care what happens to me. I'm a worthless, fat, ugly girl with no redeeming qualities. I've been sexually assaulted before - multiple times - and I hate myself because the only thing I could think is that I managed to finally do something useful by letting someone use me. I've been abusing opiate painkillers for months just to feel the float. I'd do any drug put in front of me no matter what it did. Cocaine? Sure. Heroin? Yeah. Krokodil? Fine. Faster death. I want to feel alive again. I have no money, I can't graduate college, my mom has the same disorder and flits back and forth between loving me like the best thing in the world and telling me she's never wanted such a horrible, disgusting daughter. I love my family, but when things get bad, they're terrible. My dad has always been there for me, but he doesn't understand that there is something wrong with me. I've tried to get help, but it seems to boil down to people saying i'm just just lazy and making excuses. My grades have never been good, but my therapist in high school always said I was depressed because of my grades and that If I busted my ass to get grades my depression would disappear. I believed it was true. Was it? I don't know. I tried so hard. I really did. I swear to god I did. I'm just too stupid. Nothing changed. My only brother hates me and he always has. The rest of my family knows nothing about me and doesn't care to. My life has been filled with people telling me i'm not good enough. Nothing i've ever done has made someone proud of me. I'm nothing. Look at me now. I wouldn't blame you if you were reading this with contempt. My family never had much money, but what little money after family tragedies were used to take me traveling around the world. I've been clothed, i've been fed, i've been to a baker's dozen of countries, i'm not in an abusive relationship (that i'm aware of), i have a car... I'm just a crying, spoiled child. yet, I only use for my life now is to be a person to make others feel good. I'll give up everything I have for them. I have no reason to stay without them. I don't understand how my boyfriend could even say he loved me, regardless of if there was truth behind it. I can't stop eating or he gets concerned and I eat just so he won't worry. I want to sell my body but I'd never betray his trust like that - I love him. I don't understand how people like me. I hate everything about myself. There is nothing about me that anyone you grabbed off the street couldn't do better. I am a failure. I wish everyone would wake up tomorrow and hate me from the bottom of their hearts. I love them all dearly but somehow also resent that they care for me so much. I can't leave this place because I don't want to make them sad, but I am not happy. I smile and joke and no one suspects a thing. Everything i used to love; Music (I used to be a violinist and solo vocal performer (soprano)), video games, reading, movies, friends... Nothing is fun. Nothing makes me happy. My whole life is just a parade of lies so everyone is happy and no one knows. I'm a dishonest, disgusting liar. If they woke up hating me from the depths of their souls tomorrow, I could finally do it. I could finally just make everything stop. I don't care if the afterlife is floating in endless darkness for eternity. No one would have to suffer from my presence. From my failures. From my lies. From the frustration of feeling like I'm //trying// to get their attention when they see the scars of what I've done to myself. From the disappointment they feel when I cancel plans a day or two in advance because I just can't get out of bed. I'm toxic for everyone in I come into contact with. As long as I am alive, people around me will suffer. So why... Why do they want me here? They say such nice things about me that aren't true.

198606,"I just want to vent.

It is been on my mind lately, and I want answers. Can I really survive this feeling of anxiety, fear, sadness, etc..? I don't know if I really am depressed but I know that these feelings are bothering me for a very long time and it is getting worse as the time passes by. All these years of suffering makes me feel like I'm inside a cave and not a tunnel because I can't see an opening from the other side of this instead it is always dead ends. It makes me want to give up, no matter how many times I cheer up myself there is always something that brings me down.

I just found out recently that my brother feels the same thing, he came out by telling to my aunt and uncle of what he feel after all these years of staying at home and not even trying to find a job. There are times that I suspected that he was depressed but I'm more convinced that he was just lazing around and now I know what he truly feel. My uncle strictly told me to help my brother but I don't know what to do. When I said the same thing on my parents, they are convinced that I'm faking it and sometimes they said that I'm no good at all. And now most of my relatives are asking me to help my brother from the same thing that I've been feeling? Why? Is it because I finished college and my brother is not? Is it because I am the first one who got a job instead of my brother? Or am I the only one who they can depend upon? I know I sounded like a bad person even I know my brother's condition but I had enough.

It's been a very long time since I seek help from other people. I decided to stop because I don't think people's advice and opinions can't help me. I seek help but do nothing with it. I never follow up and now I make my life more miserable instead. Some considers this as narcissistic trait but I can't help it.",suicide

198609,"Mental Hospital, should you admit yourself? I did, AMA.I had been thinking of wanting to die lately. Every day, all day. And I’m not going to lie. I still do sometimes. But it’s not all the time. I’ve been rapidly declining with anxiety &amp; depression, but was put on a waiting list for therapy. However with how rapid I was declining I needed immediate help. I felt desperate. I felt like I was going crazy. Like a psychotic break or something. THAT crazy. So I did research upon research upon research. About what mental hospitals are like. How to admit myself. Which one in my area had the best feedback/reviews. I was very afraid. As from what I read, it was only a 50/50 chance. Either a great decision. Or the worst. I was extremely desperate, so I packed my bag and left to the nearest hospital. Went to the front desk, and told them I wanted to die and needed help. And that’s the start of my story. 

If any of you are considering this, which I think you should, ask me anything you’d like to know. So hopefully you won’t be as nervous as I am. Not all hospitals are the same. But they’re pretty similar. So I’ll do my best to answer your questions. ",suicide

I've grown up with metal illness in my family. I've had abusive parents and I'm the oldest our of four, so I've spent most of my life taking care of my abused mother and siblings. 

I married at 19 with the first man that ever showed me love or affection. I'm now 34 and miserable. I have 2 children. And for the last 3 years I've thought about suicide everyday. 

Long story short, we were super happy, I gave up all my dreams and aspirations to be with him, to support him and his military career and when I needed him most to support and love me, i found he had someone else during a deployment...it broke me. 

I was working as a wedding photographer and I loved it so much. It was everything, I was always artistic and i loved seeing people in love. And now I do a wedding and I cry...I'm more than sad. It hurts. 

Now everyday, I pass by a man I loved and live with him just to keep our family together. 

I'm not perfect, after the infidelity...I let myself loose. I didnt care anymore. Which made me feel worse. Because I'm not someone who lies or keeps secrets. 

Right now I'm in love with a very sweet man. He is very successful in what he does, hes genuine and kind, yet I'm still married because when I tried to leave my husband tried to off himself. Now I'm trapped and lost. The only way out would be if I wasnt here anymore...Even though im in love love with this other man, I know he can find way better than me...

I just want to not be in pain anymore...I dont want to be conflicted...I don't want to hurt anyone.

Hello, two days ago I asked a friend of mine who I thought was pretty close with me if he wanted to go hammocking with me during virtual school (I’m a junior in hs) and he said he can’t but we agreed on him calling me a bit after school was done to let me know he was coming over to pick me up. Well I waited and waited, but I was super bummed when night came around and he hadn’t called back. I found out later that night that he hung out with two other best friends of mine because they sent photos in the gc. So I was even more bummed, I know I probably should’ve called and asked what was up but I didn’t want to seem needy because to be honest these were the first real friends I’ve made and I didn’t want to mess things up. I feel like they mean more to me than I do to them. The next day he doesn’t ever message back or call so I decided I’d just move on and try to make some better friends because I had always felt like I didn’t fit in but this just confirmed it. Anyways today he messaged me and told me the same friends were coming over to his house to spend the night and if I wanted to come. I didn’t respond and a few minutes later the other friends call me. I didn’t pick up I just let it ring, I really thought these guys were my bros but I feel betrayed and kind of alone now. In a few years I probably will forget all about this and just chalk it up to high school drama but rn it still hurts a little. Anywho, should I just ignore any further messages and just move on and drop these “friends?” I wish I could call them and say what’s up with him ghosting me when we were supposed to go hiking but I’m not a conflict person and I’m worried that he may just make a good excuse and I’ll just fall for it because I am kinda desperate.

My favorite teacher is only kind to me because I'm good in her class, not because she enjoys my personality.
My best friend only liked me because I had money, walked her home most days, and sat next to her in class. My personality ran her off.
I've never had a boyfriend because I have nothing to offer personality-wise and my looks aren't much to speak of, so he couldn't fuck me and enjoy it.
People have used me as a punching bag or a lapdog for years, and that's partially my fault because I have the perfect character for it; anxious, weak, quiet, spineless, and self hating.... unless you're actually kind to me;then I'm a spiteful rude moody cunt.

I'm a failure both socially and academically. I wish I had been strangled to death by my umbilical cord and my mom had adopted like she'd planned. I'm sure that kid would have been very happy for the opportunity I wasted.

I went to my school counselor once and told her I wanted to die.

Fast Forward now: Working full time as a graphic designer and taking 3 to 4 community college classes to get my associates degree. 

No friends. No love interests (Even kind of tired of women.). All of my family is useless in having someone to talk to except my Uncle in Law, however, he's not good with this sort of problem. Father ignored me as a kid, mother left and jumped back into my life 3 times until ultimately for good. I'm having to reparent myself every day. Overweight, almost no confidence, barely making enough to survive, find everyone im surrounded by annoying because they seem to lack life perspective or character. This doesn't make for a good social life. My life is a very lonely one. I live alone, go to the movies/out to eat alone. BUT it's comfortable. 

At this point, all I do is hate my job during the day (I know it could be a lot worse), get home, play World of Warcraft, read very deep books before I go to sleep, rinse repeat. 

But it wasn't until today, that I thought about myself dying, and smiled/even had a welcoming feeling towards. I'm not afraid of it at all. Because ultimately, I could live without living. I mean, ultimately I don't have much going for me. I don't enjoy my life all that much, and im too much of a self conscious, fat, introvert, coward. 

Yes I could network. Yes I should exercise and eat right. Yes I should break out of my anti social shell. Yes I should take more risks. And I have. That's why I have the job/apartment/care I have. But it's not enough for me to be scared of losing.

Lately I have thought about suicide in this subconscious and objective manner. I don't necessarily want to kill myself. But I'm sure that fantasizing about it can't be good.

198669,"I'm miserableHey guys, never thought I'd find myself here. I'm 20 years old, active duty in the military, and I absolutely hate my life. I have a good friend group but I can never find the courage to tell them how I feel. I failed the school for a job I originally planned on doing while being weeks away from graduating. I'm now working a job where my superiors do not value me or my friends well being at all and I am beyond physically and emotionally exhausted. I feel like a total failure, I feel out of place in this position, I feel like I don't belong, I feel like my youth has been drained out of me. 

I lost the love of my life after we had been together for 3 years because of the distance. I loved her so much, and now she's gone. Everyone told me I was going to be so happy, and so successful before I left for bootcamp, now I dread going back home because I feel like such a fucking failure.

I was physically abused as a kid, and I grew up with the advice of ""being a man"" rather than talking about my feelings. I feel like such a fucking pussy everytime I want to talk about how sad and miserable I am. I was raped as well and I finally confessed to my family about it before I left when I was informed my rapist was attending my going away party. My confession was met with skepticism and doubt for the most part, you know, the whole ""women can't rape men"" thing. lol. 

I have nothing I look forward to in my day anymore. I used to look forward to just a shower at the end of the day, and we no longer have hot water. The gym doesn't even make me happy anymore. I have spent my whole life sprinting from my problems and I feel like I'm crawling now. I am tired of running guys. I'm tired of feeling miserable. I look in the mirror and all I can see is a fucking idiot that looks dead inside. I just want to be fucking happy. I never had a childhood, I was forced to grow up so fast. I feel like I can't go to anyone. I just want to die. I don't have a plan, but I spend all day thinking about how awesome it would be if I could just end my miserable life. I'm sorry if this isn't significant enough to be on here guys ",suicide

i'm at the max safe dose on my antidepressants and still want to die.

over the past few years i've realized that the best thing for EVERYBODY I LOVE is to not be around me.

i'm sick of pretending i'm fine so i don't draw attention to myself. i'm sick of smoking weed just so i can fall asleep...and the weed doesn't even help the anxiety anymore, anyway. i'm sick of being completely alone, with nobody i can call on the phone to talk to and nobody i can go visit just because i need a hug.

the weed doesnt help anymore. the doctors don't help anymore. my medications don't help anymore.

i can't call the suicide hotline ppl cuz they are dicks (one actually told me to ""just do it already""). i can't go to a hospital because, if they put me on suicide watch....i miss work and lose my job and THEN i kill myself... even if they temporarily manage to get me calm again.

i just...i dont have goals anymore. i'm just going through the motions. i'm a psych major and i keep telling myself ""just give it one more day, the pain will lessen back down to manageable""...but it doesn't. it hasn't. 

at work they moved me away from my emotional safety net. i'm now completely alone. i was invisible all day. completely invisible.

nobody needs me. so why stick around??

i want my loved ones to be happy...and near as i can tell, they are. without me. now is the perfect time...because nobody is attached to me, nobody needs me. i wouldn't feel any guilt i i did it now.

i'm already a ghost figuratively. 25 years of dealing with this depression. i just want to fall asleep and never wake up.

i know i'm only posting this because a part of me still wants to be talked out of it...but please don't take it personal if none of you can. i have doctors and therapists...if they can't save me, you probably can't, either.",suicide
198677,"If today were my last day, I couldn't make something happen that would *make* me want to go onIf I were planning to CTB tomorrow (I'm not, don't worry) and had an entire day, or even week, to do something incredibly risky to make my life worth living, it wouldn't happen.  

&amp;nbsp;

Examples:

&amp;nbsp;

- On my last day, I could take my remaining savings and sink it as a huge trade on a penny stock. Nope, wouldn't work. (Dabbled in day trading before and had to quit b/c i was always losing)

&amp;nbsp;

- Could attempt to speak to every single person I've known in my life to ignite friendship, or say something that would hopefully have a touching impact.  This wouldn't work either, because I've never been able to make friends, and the times I did try to reach out to a few select people in my past, they either ignored my attempt or their interest was extremely muted.  I've also been unable to ever tell anyone how I really feel even if it is extremely positive because I get the sense that people are scared of me and don't want to get involved in any way. 

&amp;nbsp;

- Could give to the homeless.  Sure, I could (and do on occasion).  They can always use a stranger's help.  But I can be assured that nothing would come out of it that'd make me want to continue living, even though I'd be glad I helped a little.  

&amp;nbsp;

- Could call some media outlet and speak for a certain cause or simply to vent how I feel about certain things that are going on in this world (suppression of information from some big businesses who don't care about the health of their consumers) and hope that it gets published.  Fat chance of that happening. Money is more important than health nowadays. And I've noticed that the only health risks that get certain media attention are **after** there has been a slew of deaths in which use of the product can directly be proven as the cause. 

&amp;nbsp;

- Could stand in the middle of a busy downtown park and scream about certain injustices that are happening in this world. No, I'd just get locked up in a mental ward.  Greed and corruption to continue unsilenced, with any one person lacking the clout to stop it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Nothing I do on my last day here on this earth would help me feel connected to another human being. I'd be the laughingstock, the circus freak, or at best mildly understood and then forgotten.

&amp;nbsp;

It may seem like I'm naysaying any positive impact I could have on this world, but my efforts have been largely unsuccessful due to my inability to connect with others and people consequently misreading my motives. (It sucks to be Autistic)

&amp;nbsp;

There is one person left on this planet who cares, so that is why I'm still here. Can't speak for anyone else...

198687,"Why do most people view suicide as a bad thing when sometimes it isn't?Hi, I'm new here. I think suicide is sometimes the smartest and best option. Not for everyone, obviously. It depends on the individual's situation. But if someone has a chronic health issue, be it mental or physical, and decides that they'd rather not exist, then why is that not a valid choice? None of us chose to exist and none of us chose the conditions we exist under. Surely, the decision to opt-out should be a human right. Why do the majority of people feel that everyone's obliged to keep existing until something else inevitably takes them out (e.g. illness or an accident or murder or old age etc.)? Why can't we decide for ourselves if our particular life is worth living? This whole 'suicide is selfish', 'life is a gift' thing is very weird to me and doesn't seem to be based on real logic or real compassion. Everyone dies eventually, so why can't people take it into their own hands and not be seen as 'crazy' or somehow morally lacking?",suicide

198695,"Oh no, I've said too muchThree years ago my Dad died of cancer. We lived together &amp; before his diagnosis we would constantly bump heads, he would freak out on me over stupid trivial shit &amp; effectively treat me like a child. Put my shoes on to literally go in the back yard, where am I going. Sleep ""too long"", come in my room screaming. Suggest an idea for the house, no that's stupid, why bother. Have friends over to watch a movie or play a game? Nope, Dad's sleeping on the couch &amp; will get pissed. Not that anyone really wanted to come over when the house smelled like cat piss from them literally pissing all over. Cats or me? Guilt trip. On &amp; on, for the sake of brevity. 

Prior to his diagnosis he had various health problems, he'd call me at work, on a date, my girlfriend's at the time; ""Can you come home?"", And I would. I'd get home and say, ""ok, let's go to the Dr/ER"" and he'd refuse. To the point it was effecting my professional &amp; personal relationships. 

I wanted him to die just so I could live my own damn life. 

One day we get into it, I'm fucking over it all, I say I'm done I'm moving out, don't know where I'm going. My Dad then says to me that he's going to kill himself then &amp; that I may as well take a knife &amp; slit his throat. Anger, sadness, remorse, guilt; I felt it all &amp; then some. I stayed. I've never told anyone this.

Dad has cancer, I become his primary care giver, power of attorney, power of medical. I don't sleep, I don't eat, I don't have a support group, I break down mentally. Unscheduled Dr office visit, My Dr isn't in &amp; the other Dr doesn't see people for ""stress"". To the ER, they make a Dr apt... A week later at my apt I tell the Dr I DO NOT want prozac or the like, she writes me script for prozac. I haven't seen a Dr since.

Get Xanax to robot through changing Dad's diapers &amp; being on call 24/7. One Aunt helped out as much as she could, which I'm thankful for. One night she's staying over, I'm laying in bed having an anxiety attack &amp; absolutely sleep deprived &amp; impulsively swallow about 10 Xanies. Not to die, I just wanted more than an hours sleep. That ER trip is another story in itself.

Dad Dies. Family abandons me. I had this grandiose idea my friends would rally around me in my time of need, at least one or two,  one did briefly. Lot's of ""If you need anything""s, very very...very few followed through, but most of those only when convenient. I cry, a lot. I keep the 3 cats because they feel like part of him but shortly after have to have one put down. I think about suicide, at lot, Pick Dad's birthday. My Mom is my sole rock but I can't confide in her because I don't want her worrying, her brother hung himself. My Mom is the only reason I'm alive. Cry ad infinitum. Last two cats die a few months ago within a week+ apart. The guilt, regret &amp; loneliness is unbearable.

It's safer then other bottom surgery, and it's really rewarding. The only reason you haven't heard of it is because our society it so afraid of people not fitting into the binary.

There's so much going on in my life...I have trichotillomania, PTSD, depression, and anhidrosis possibly more illnesses...I'm tired of waking up over heated to the point of feel weak and ill the entire day and it happens so often...

I almost died so many times throughout my life....I remember being thrown in the backseat of my mother's car by my mom to protect me from gunshots, being in a fire surrounded by flames with my sisters and my mother, seeing my mother stab my father and his blood everywhere in our bathroom when I was six because he molested my eldest sister....I was also my mother mostly throughout my life...Molested throughout my life...Raped when I was very little....The list goes on....

Despite what has happened, I love my family to bits and pieces.....I have issues with them and feelings of not belonging but I do have fond memories I want to hold on, until the very last moments of my death however I may die.....

 I left my family to move out of state to breathe and find myself so to speak but I barely have contact with them because I am just in a runt and I am dating who lowers my self esteem,etc....Yet he says he cares which is bullshit and he's the only one who knows what I am planning to do...I doubt he would stop me if I actually tried anything...........

Nobody cares about anybody.

I have a lot to be proud of, and a lot of people in my life claim to be proud of me. But knowing that objectively my life is great, only makes it worse that subjectively I want to die.  Every time a family member or a distant friend says, it seems like you're doing so much, or they're so proud of me for working hard, it honestly makes me feel worse. I look through these comment boards and I hear about people who go through life with no one around them. Ironically, I spend tons of time with others, and often get invited places to hang out and do things, and occasionally I go, and I think I even appear to have a good time. But still when I'm done I feel miserable and like I want to die. Some people talk about how they can't get out of bed in the morning. I work 10 and 12 hour days as a law student trying to study and apply for jobs, but honestly it just serves as a distraction from the fact that I want to die. I always go back to baseline wanting to die no matter what else I do. I've always had this feeling that I'm going to kill myself one day, even on my best days. It's scary to me to think that I could be ""accomplishing"" so much and have ""so much to be proud of"" and still feel this way. It doesn't help that I just had a close family friend who committed suicide recently. He seemed like he had his life together. He had kids a family a good job where he traveled all the time, but he was still so depressed that he killed himself. His life almost seems like a prophecy for mine and its scary. I almost wish I showed outward symptoms of being depressed and suicidal, I feel like when I tell people how I feel they assume I must be exaggerating because my life looks so good from the outside. It almost makes me ashamed to be suicidal knowing that so many other people actually have real issues they have to deal with, and I'm just here feeling miserable in spite of my pretty good life.

198775,"Reasonable SuicideI would like to preface my thought with the idea that suicide is largely and stigmatically associated with petty or temporally small states of irrevocable discourse.  My life and my cognizance stands contrarily to this vastly overtaking idea.  I've wanted to kill myself for a weighted portion of my life (not even just the latter half), but my emotional state is one of a nonchalant subject.  This may turn into a vast elaboration to which I have been long seeking alternative advice; for at this point, I have not within a decade's time deduced a single piece of viable meaningfulness.

When I was young, my sister was heavily desirous of suicide.  She started cutting her arm (approaching her wrist closer and closer each time) weeks after adopting particularly ""volatile"" music tastes (lots of screaming metal), or at least that is the term everyone attributed to it.  One day further, I was awoken by a loud consistent ballad of screams.  It was my sister, forcing scissors to her wrist and my mother tentatively but carefully placed a phone call all the while (the police arrived later).  Two years later, she would attempt suicide by overdosing on sleep medication (about 900mg worth), but she failed and discovered her eternal slumber interrupted by bright hospital lights.  Shortly following, she was transported to a psychiatric ward.  My sister was diagnosed with bipolar, and a month of mood stabilizers put her into a ""happy"" phase to follow.

I have always discovered rich curiosity in relation to human psychology, and such was that I wanted to know why my sister considered such an option a viable one.  For growing up amongst a conservative family, I hadn't a clue what could condense a person's mentality into a single focused goal of initiating a premature resignation.  Wholly was I inspired to develop a mindset that even matched or approached one rational enough to follow what produced my sister's awaited desire.  Over a large period of time, I reasoned much beside those foundational conservative views.  I declared to my (proceedingly reluctant) family that I was an Atheist upon scientific analysis and such was lead into reasoning of the abstract meaninglessness of everything.  Perhaps the subject of living enjoys life because that person is the one who is to decide, for whom they are concerned with, what the meaning of life is.  But I was bothered and shook with a bit a perpetual realization: that of which concerns the only common and converged meaning of leaving later, and not now, is that out of absolute selfishness that one may be remembered to proceed their absence.  Why read the entire book when, minus that between the extremas, we know what will happen and why not shut it with the knowledge that there is no way to modify its conclusion?  Shall we respond, ""because the book's beef is impermissible on behalf of the reader's enjoyment?"" But such would be equally and tediously false, for then life is based upon the paranoid struggle of pyramidal accomplishment.

Many reason suicide out of existential discontent, and there seems no other reasonable generalization of concluding psychological backing (because psychological conclusion is always based upon conditional paradigms).  My reason is one out of paranoid discontent with the fact that nothing shall ever be objectively known.  But shall I thence tell of those accomplishments I have done?  Perhaps you were expecting me to speak of all of the ways I have ruined my life, or perhaps I would word it as to speak of how others have ruined my life.  However, I am currently depicted in one of the highest educational statures of the world, bridging me a full ride to any graduate college that I would like.  I am knowledgeable of a sizable amount of programming languages, and I am quite a well known freelancer.  Upon entering my 'game of life,' I can proceed in making six figures with an entry level salary.  Might I note that that hitherto was included not for those who think me a narcissistic idealist, but rather those who think me a desperado.

So why a decade?  You may proceed to inquire.  Surely I've made plans to detract my position from livelihood preceding, more than once or thrice.  I am currently living in a deserted state of cognition, remaining here if only for the sake of my girlfriend, who does not wish for me to leave so soon.  No, I have not forced her into a position of liability, for she is content with the floating idea of suicide, but reasons a pleasurable stay all the while.  And such is that many of my long abided intellectual acquaintances reason identical logic, only to ask me why they still see me around each time I spot them.  The latter half of my friends I spot in my mirror each morning, and they ask me why they still see me around.  And I cannot respond with an answer that is definitively clear or blurry, but rather one that is systematically observational.",suicide
198776,"Suicidal for Traditional and Nontraditional ReasonsI'm not a very eloquent writer so I'll put this in list form. I apologize if my points are unclear...

**Nontraditional**
--Humans are greedy, selfish bastards that will do anything to get ahead
--No one can truly seek happiness because of the corruption of government and corporations
-- Social progress is at a stand still and will not move forward anytime soon
-- I'm curious as to what is on the other side. Whether it be darkness or another life of some sort. (I'm an athiest) But whatever it is, is better than what I have now. I also desire to know answers to questions that are impossible to answer here on earth.


**Traditional**
--Depressed, self loathing, worthless jackass.
--No hope of moving forward in my own life. I have no means of going to a decent college. Parents went bankrupt, no credit, no consigner, no chance of getting a job. The only way to afford college would be by joining the military, but my parents will have none of that. 
--I am an athiest and my entire family are very devout christians. I have to constantly hide who I am from them and nearly scream everytime they tell me to ""pray to god for guidance""


There's just a few main points. The only reason I havn't ended it yet is because I don't want to have others go through the emotional pain I do on a daily basis. That is starting to not become enough. Each day is harder than the last. I've been struggling for the past 7 years. (I'm only 21) Everytime I mention wanting to get help, my parents give me ""that look"" like I'm insane and then ignore me for days because they think I'm acting strangely. I don't know what to do anymore. The only people who would miss me are my family members. So why must I suffer on their behalf?

And I feel like my family, friends, everyone are constantly dumbing everything down for me. I know they don't mean to but sometimes I feel like I'm way older than I am. 

I've been through things that no 13 year old should have to. And yet here I am, years of self hatred and trauma later. I just feel like my childhood is over. And honestly with my mental state I don't think I'll be alive more than a year or two.

People always tell me I shouldn't be depressed because I have nothing to be depressed about. Sometimes I think they're right. I managed to make it to a decent uni with good grades despite suffering depression and anxiety since I was quite young. I know how privileged I am but it doesn't help. I've tried to be happy, I've tried to ""fake it till I make it"" and it's just absolute rubbish.

Hardly anyone knows about the physical and emotional abuse my mother put me through, or the sexual abuse I had at primary school, and why would they? I learnt very early on I couldn't trust people and that I had to bury my emotions deep deep down so mother couldn't use them against me. If I was anything other than a vision of perfection, all hell would break loose. It might've been easier to cope with if this torment was shared with my younger sibling, but he got off lightly. Something that both saddens and gladdens me. Mother hated me and only me. She still does. I hate her back, and yet I am bound to her unrealistic expectations of me and the pressure is immense, even across the 100+miles of physical distance I've put between us. I can't cut her out because of the effect on the rest of my family, especially my dad, who tried/tries to protect me all he can. I love him dearly and want to hang around for him, but I can't do it anymore.

I can't be perfection. I've really really tried. Every little tiny imperfection used to upset me, but now I can't even be moderately good. Everything is cascading down and I can't stop it. I am doing badly at uni. I hate it. I am so lonely and isolated that I pray my flatmates might hear me crying at all hours of the day and come see if I am okay. It's pathetic. Everything I do is pathetic. I can't even feed myself properly and my grades are getting worse and I'm just so tired.

So the guy, thinking what the hell, signs up for it. Next morning an incredibly beautiful woman is standing at his door in nothing but a pair of running shoes and a sign about her neck that reads, ""If you can catch me, you can have me."" As soon as he sees her, she takes off running. He tries to catch her, but is unable. This continues for a week, at the end of which, the man has lost 10 pounds. After this he tries the next weight loss plan, 15 pounds in a week. The next morning an even more beautiful woman is standing at the door, in similar conditions. The same happens with her as the first woman, except he almost catches her. This continues for a week, at the end of which he, as suspected, weighs 15 pounds less. Excited about this success, he decides to do the master program. Before he signs up, he is required to sign a waiver and is warned about the intensity of this plan. Still he signs up. The next morning, waiting at the door, is a hulking 300 pound muscle man with nothing but a pair of running shoes, a raging erection, and a sign around his neck that says, ""If I catch you, you're mine!"" The man was supposed to lose 25 pounds in the week; he lost 34.

7. A man was having premature ejaculation problems so he went to the doctor. The doctor said, ""When you feel like you are getting ready to ejaculate, try startling yourself."" That same day the man went to the store and bought himself a starter pistol and ran home to his wife. That night the two were having sex and found themselves in the 69 position. The man felt the urge to ejaculate and fired the starter pistol. The next day he went back to the doctor who asked how it went. The man answered, ""Not well. When I fired the pistol, my wife pooped on my face, bit three inches off my penis, and my neighbor came out of the closet with his hands in the air.""

8. Two cowboys are out on the range talking about their favorite sex position. One says, ""I think I enjoy the rodeo position the best."" ""I don't think I have ever heard of that one,"" says the other cowboy. ""What is it?"" ""Well, it's where you get your girl down on all four, and you mount her from behind. Then you reach around, cup her t\*ts, and whisper in her ear, 'boy these feel almost as nice as your sisters.' Then you try and hold on for 30 seconds.""

9. A man gets on a bus, and ends up sitting next to a very attractive nun. Enamored with her, he asks if he can have sex with her. Naturally, she says no, and gets off the bus. The man goes to the bus driver and asks him if he knows of a way for him to have sex with the nun. ""Well,"" says the bus driver, ""every night at 8 o'clock, she goes to the cemetery to pray. If you dress up as God, I'm sure you could convince her to have sex with you."" The man decides to try it, and dresses up in his best God costume. At eight, he sees the nun and appears before her. ""Oh, God!"" she exclaims. ""Take me with you!"" The man tells the nun that she must first have sex with him to prove her loyalty. The nun says yes, but tells him she prefers anal sex. Before you know it, they're getting down to it, having nasty, grunty, loud sex. After it's over, the man pulls off his God disguise. ""Ha, ha!"" he says, ""I'm the man from the bus!"" ""Ha, ha!"" says the nun, removing her costume, ""I'm the bus driver!""

10. A woman is having a hard time getting her tomatoes to ripen so she goes to her neighbor with her problem. The neighbor says, ""All you have to do is go out at midnight and dance around in the garden naked for a few minutes, and the tomatoes will become so embarrassed, they will blush bright red."" The woman goes out at midnight and dances around her garden naked for a few minutes. The next morning, the neighbor comes over to the woman's house and asks the woman if her tomatoes have turned red. The woman says ""No, they're still green, but I noticed the cucumbers grew four inches!""

198787,"I’ve planned my death for a yearLast November, I found the perfect way to die. I thought that I should at least give it time. 

On January, I was set on it. 

By May, I couldn’t be more depressed and suicidal. I was dreaming about death while sitting at the table, eating dinner with my family. I felt sick then I felt like nothing. 

In July, I started looking at the minimum height to jump off of, so the fall was fatal. In reality, there isn’t a sure height to die on, only the right way to do it. Remove your clothes and shoes, fall on your head. It’s the backward instructions for a suicidal diver. 

When August hit, I’ve already bought the plane tickets, booked a hotel room. 

Only in September did I realise what I was doing. I didn’t stop. In contrary, I started planning for more. It had to be perfect, I thought. I looked at maps and weather conditions. I checked everything. 

There was no turning back.

All I do is mostly work, to have my mind occupied. Whenever I don't, I try to think of things to do to make my siblings happy, to be sure that they will never have the need to ask themselves if anybody loves them, because they'll be sure I do. All my goals evolve around that. I don't think Ill ever be happy, as whenever I stop working or doing an activity all I can think about is death. I don't really know what to do, at times I am disgusted with myself and I think if my siblings knew what I did when they were not around they would be disgusted with me too.

I just want to end it. There is just to much pain in this life to enjoy it. I have tried so much, but I have failed much more. 
The must crushing aspect is this unbearable loneliness. Maybe I am just a wimp but because of borderline and depression, am I can't hold this anymore.
Just seeing a couple, or hearing about love in one more pop song gives me shivers down my spine. I want this so bad. Someone to hold me and tell me everything is going to be alright. I want someone so cuddle the living crap out of and appreciates me. But I know I am not gonna find this ever ... And with every day going on it is getting harder. I have already set my goal, that if I am still single with 25 will definitely kill myself, but I don't know if I can hold out that long. To go to sleep every night with so many painful memories is premium nightmare fuel everytime I close my eyes.
Exercise, talking with friends, talking with professionals and everything you can imagine, I have tried and given up. I want the permission for my final choice... Let me give up, one last time and let me rest for I can not bear this anymore... But our primal instincts will torture us with the will to live forever

198814,"Absolutely not helpfulSome of my family members seem to think it’s okay to keep telling me at random occasions that they are so happy that I’m still here to be able to be at whatever the occasion is. It’s been over 3 years since the attempt that they know about and I’m still hearing it. It’s so frustrating and really doesn’t help me. If I had had my way they wouldn’t have even known about that attempt but I didn’t have a choice in the matter but I haven’t let any of them know about any other attempts or the fact that I’m still really depressed and have suicidal ideations.

Does anyone else have the same problem? Does it usually help you or make things worse? I don’t want to tell them to stop because I’d rather just avoid the subject with them but they need to stop. At my younger brother’s wedding my aunt decided to tell me at the end of the night that it was really nice to finally actually see me happy (I was putting on a good face despite really not wanting to be there) and for me to have been able to make it (tone made it obvious that she didn’t just mean that I was able to get the day off but meant that I have survived) for my brother’s wedding. I had really not been doing well all day and I swear that comment made everything 10x worse and I’m so glad I was leaving because I couldn’t hide any of my emotions anymore and I started thinking about trying to kill myself again.

It has been 3 years since I last saw my old friends, they moved on, they have their own lives, moved to other cities to study.

The reason why I don’t have a name for it is because I never told anyone about it so I could see a professional to see what’s wrong with me. But I probably have some form of mental illness so what’s the point for some doctor to put a label on me and call me crazy.

I’m not gonna kill myself because I want to die. I’m gonna do it because I don’t want to exist anymore. Like little school kids who wait with impatience for the end of the school day on a Friday, that’s how I feel about sleeping. And I’m am severely disappointed when I wake up. 

Every year that has went by the hope that one day I’ll be happy and these thoughts will be behind has faltered. To the point that I’m looking a 400mg of painkillers. 100 mg less than what I need to finish the job and finally get what I want. Sleep. 

I am truly miserable. Waking up everyday feels like a chore and life moves on without me anyway so why do I have to stay and watch it leave? 

The only thing stopping me for doing is that I want to try out everything before I do this. This is my last resort. If nothing else works I know this will. There only so many more things I can do. 

1) Call/Chat with Suicide Hotline (I’ve did it before and it didn’t work, I got frustrated and stop replying.) 
2) Tell My Mom/ Get some professional help
3) Try the Medication. 

And if all else fails then I’ll be back. Announcing my goodbyes to the world that has continuously thrown punches while I was down. By then I’ll would have written my letter and would probably leave it on my phone or a notebook for them to find.

recently, my anxiety has been horrible. my stutter has come back, i've picked back up my stupid coping mechanism of scratching my hands until they're raw and bleeding, i disassociate constantly, and i am always on the verge of having a panic attack. i have been diagnosed with panic disorder along with generalized anxiety disorder, and my panic attacks bring out a side of me that's scary for both myself and others to experience.

my mom and my school keep bringing up one of the new additions to my traumas; sexual abuse/assault 2.0. i am so nauseous constantly, and can't eat much or else i'll throw up. granted, this has made losing weight easier, but it's a nuisance.

i miss alcohol and i miss my pills. they were my one escape from reality aside from my involuntary disassociation, and now they're gone. i know, it's good that they're gone, but my brain chemicals don't like it. maybe life's just taunting me about my dead alcoholic father, or maybe i was just destined to have a shitty liver. who knows.

i know the basics. ""you're young, don't worry"", ""you have so much to live for"", ""it will get better"". i know this, but at the same time, i don't. i just can't believe it to be true. sure, i have a future in mind, but also, i've been nothing but a failure and a disappointment in my life. i mean- i can't even kill myself right.

i have most sharp things kept away from me ever since my last few attempts, but i did find a pizza cutter the other day. i was honestly considering it, but i came across a video on my youtube feed. the title was ""it's okay, you're okay"" i think, and it was just a short video of just chill music. i don't know why, but even if it was just coincidence, i needed it. i needed someone to tell me that everything's alright. i don't know how long this will last me, but i'm alive and trying to keep myself from disassociating. i'll probably just go to sleep soon.

The person who I love most in the world is the one that's taking my life. At least some wanker might get entertained from this. Alright, you want to know what led me to this. You ask, and I shall please, as fucking always. I'm done being nice. Okay, so my destructive relationship with my best friend started like this. Lets call her Sarah, because why not? Sarah is a pretty name. Anyways, I met ""Sarah"" this summer on tinder. It was amazing. And horrible. After like five days of talking to each other from morning to night we uttered the magic words. Yes yes, I know I said this was about my best friend. It is. But we started in an other way. So yeah, after like five days we both said ""I love you"". It was insane. I was walking on sunshine. (Side note, we have been texting during the time I'm writing this, and now she asked if I'm mad. Of course I'm fucking mad.) Back to the story. So this girl has gone through so much, that's one of the things I love about her, she is so strong. I'm not gonna tell you, I don't know you, and I'm not gonna spill my best friends dark past. But say this, I bet you that you wouldn't survive what she has. I wouldn't. So because of her trauma she has a really hard time trusting people. And during these five days I can't even fucking remember how many times she pushed me away. She has said so many awful things to me. So so many. But I forgave her, because I knew that she probably had PTSD or something (she didn't have any official diagnoses at the time). I could at least feel that she didn't mean it. I also assumed she was bipolar or something, because one day she'd say she loved me, and one day she hated me. And she did not keep that hate to herself. But the summer went on. I couldn't handle her outbursts, and she could not trust me. So we took a break from each other. I went overseas for work, and we started talking a bit. For the past few weeks we have really reconnected, we both love each other, but in a non romantic way. At least I love her, she says she loves me, but I can't really trust anything she says anymore. You might think that being friend zoned sucks, but it doesn't. Not when you are such deeply connected with someone. I love being friends with her. It's pretty much the same as before, but it's not as complicated. Except that now it is. During the summer she had a lot of anxiety attacks, but during the autumn they went away and she had been feeling great. But today she texted me and said that she almost got an anxiety attack. I tried to get a hold of her to help her calm down but of course she ignored me. I was worried to death. What if she fainted? What if she hit her head on the way down? Is she dead? No she wasn't. A few hours later she texted me that she was fine. I was of course relieved, but there was a thought that I couldn't get rid of, what if I'm the reason her anxiety attacks are back? Of course she texts me exactly that. She said that she isn't sure, but she thinks I'm the reason her anxiety attacks are back. She said a part of her didn't trust me at all. And that a part of her didn't even believe that I was overseas. She has a pattern. She pulls me close and makes me love her to the point where I would die for her, then she pushes me away. All the fucking time. Right now I'm feeling awful. She has gone to bed, and I'm trying to keep myself alive. And looking at my post now I see that it's a mess, but I don't have the energy to proofread and format it. I love her so so much. I can't live without her. But she can't live with me. That only leaves me with one option right? I'm hurting her just by being close to her. So I can't be close to her. I know what I need to do.",suicide
198840,"Feeling GuiltyMy parents are in the middle of a divorce (they've been separated for a long time) and I live with my mom. She has PTSD from living with my dad, and her whole personality changed because of it. She's so stressed out and I feel like telling her I want to die (for the millionth time) would only make her feel worse. It would be so much easier to just leave silently. My dad has good health insurance but by golly I sure wish that the last fee he'd ever have to pay is for my cremation/ burial. I've been a financial and emotional drain on them since I was a baby. I sit up all night, fighting with myself, ""Should I go get the pills and the rope?"" and eventually pass out thinking about it. I get yelled at for everything, and I sit there, screaming silently, ""Can't you see how much I'm hurting?!"" Whenever I do say how much pain I'm in from just being ALIVE, I get brushed off and told, ""You could have it worse."" I wish I had it worse so that I could justify feeling this way. I live constantly disassociating, and being yelled at, and being misunderstood, and I just can't deal with it anymore. I have everything ready, all that's left is my willpower. 

Sorry for the long post",suicide
198841,"I don't know what to feel.My antidepressants don't make me feel good, they stop me from wanting to kill myself constantly. I have friends, but they're all closer with eachother than they are with me, and I feel like I'm just kinda observing, which has been the case as far as I remember in friend groups.  


 I enjoy some parts of life still. I love playing with my dog, and watching movies and chess with my dad. But lately my depression has been fucking horrible. My ex left me 2 months ago after she and I were distant for a few months, which was the worst possible time, because October-December is the hardest part of the year, because my mom before she passed, and I would always do a lot of shit around the time. The worst part is that objectively, my life is good. I have family who loves me, and I do things I enjoy. I have no reason to feel this way. Compared to what I've seen here, my life is perfect, which makes me feel guilty about feeling how I feel.

 I don't even know if I wanna kill myself, I just wish I wasn't ever born, or could cease existence with no memory of me, or at least have things get better, and not be on this shitty cycle. I just wanna be happy, without the gnawing thought in the back of my mind of how everything is. Our existence is meaningless, we're less than a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of the universe. Nothing we do will matter in the long run, and we all wash away. I hate knowing that nothing matters. I wanna give in and say fuck it and just not worry about things, but I feel like that'll cause me to feel worse, and be bad for the people I care about. Sorry for the rant, I'm not even sure if this is the place to post this. I just don't know, and need help.",suicide

198854,"Be respectful Yo why can’t people just chill out
People can’t take a joke, shoot down everything you have to say, drown you out and shove you away
People who just hate everything y’know
Why does there have to be so much fighting and violence for the smallest fucking thing
Why can’t everyone just be cool with each other, and not be a bunch of dirtbags who have nothing better to do than to hate other people
There was a guy who killed a manager that asked him to wear a mask
People don’t care if you get corona from not wearing a mask but they care if you spread it to those who will fuckin die from it
I don’t really want to be singling people out but fuck all y’all who can’t accept anything
Facts are facts
If you’re wrong then learn about it instead of arguing your opinion to your grave
Life’s not fair, it makes no sense, and it’s shitty sometimes
My immune system is the strongest out of all my family and I’m the healthiest but I’m lying here suffering from covid, holding onto each breath, breaking out in tears from the pain of breathing
If I can lay in bed all day and suffer from not being able to breathe and seizures then you can learn not to kill someone for something so small and stupidly easy to do
Everyone else in my family got a cough, and they can’t even accept the fact that I’m in excruciating pain
You can believe whatever you want
You can believe you’re superior
You can believe you’re right and everyone else is wrong
You can believe someone is a nigga, cracker, terrorist, yankee, dixie, jew, whatever 
Just be respectful 
If you can just shut your mouth for one goddamn second you may be able to learn something 
Just stop hurting each other
See a person by what they say and do, not just the racial and sexual stereotypes, not what political party their in, or just because other people like them
There’s always one person that ruins everyone else’s lives
Don’t let that be you
Be as respectful as you can be, and maybe we’ll be able to save millions of lives
If you don’t agree with something, either learn more about it, teach the FACTS you know about it, or just ignore it
You’re you, be proud of it, respect others, and just don’t be a piece of shit all together
You don’t have to be better than everybody else

198859,"Looking young sucks ass Alright so one week ago, I (M18) saw that a local restaurant that is literally less than a block away and noticed that they were hiring for cashiers. I was intending on eating here but I decided to apply myself into this cashier position. The lady who I assumed was the manager told me that they weren't hiring at the moment but let my sign my name and number down somewhere ""just in case"". She also asked my age in which I told her I was 18.

Well today I went in with my mom and older sister and she just noticed that they were ""hiring"" or so I thought with the quotation marks. Same lady, looks me dead in the eyes for a second and then hands my sister a application.

Now I'm not mad at my sister, I feel like shes gonna get this job, amazing, congrats. But this is fucking bullshit man. Just because I look like a 13 year old doesnt mean that I'm gonna perform like a 13 year old as well. It's hard as fuck to find a job when you look like a kid",non-suicide

I want to kill myself and reborn as a man because I never passed as a man when I once transitioned.

I have this strange urge to kill my piece of shit ‘friend’ who I’m sure has used me for sex and always takes long to get back to me and as many men as I can find before killing myself.

I've been doing this for as long as I can remember. I know there is some happiness in my life, but it's mostly superficial. My main reason for living will be leaving soon and I don't know how much longer I can hang on. I've never been this scared before. 

I can see myself writing all this and imagine what all people would say, what I would say, in response, but this time it just feels so hollow. Nice things we're programmed to say, because deep down we're all nice people but sometimes misunderstood. I've said and heard it all before, it seems like. 

What do you do when talking and writing isn't enough? I so desperately to be held right now, to be told everything will be ok even if it's only a lie, just so I can get through this night. Because right now, I don't know how else I can make it this time.",suicide

Yes I have talked to him about this before around a year ago and I have tried to improve myself since then but things just stayed the same I can't take it anymore yet he doesn't even care about me at all anymore apparently. It's just fucking pathetic because we have been friends for 12 years how little he cares and i'm so close to actually doing it now since no one will care if I'm gone.

I love animals, I have two dogs and 3 cockatiels, I love they so much I wouldn’t imagine my life without them.

but 1 month ago, my family adopted a kitten, she was 1,5 month old, and I loved her, but with time i begin to have anger of her for no reason like a instinct, but I still loved her, but I begin to suffocate her, I didn’t know why and I would stop immediately, then I begin punch myself and the wall of anger because I was hurting a animal that I loved, this have repeated 5 times but In the 6 time my parents have left and I suffocated her so much that she pissed herself and almost died, I leaved the room immediately after that, disgusted with myself, I checked her 20 minutes later she was okay but 1 hour later my parents returned and I checked her to give food she have passed minutes before, I panicked and I know it was my fault, I run to my mother with her in my arms and tell her maybe one of our dogs killed her trying to play, but I know it was me.

We buried her a week ago and I feel disturbed, but if it was a normal person that person would be completely destroyed I am just disturbed.

 today I tried to kill myself again.

 I was with the knife in my throat I felled the knife cutting my skin but I suddenly stoped, I don’t know why but I still want to kill myself but I am afraid of death I don’t know what to do, I feel like a pain in my body, I just want everything to stop.",suicide

My hair wasn't brushed and my dad told me to turn around and he began feeling it and inspecting it. I don't like my hair being touched at all, whether it's brushed or not. I've told him this *many* times. Both when my hair was and wasn't brushed. After he feeled up my hair, he told me to go brush it. And because I was extremely uncomfortable and a bitch, I just said ""okay"" in a bitchy tone and tried walking away. He stopped me and threatened to hurt me and he shoved me in front of him. He said he was tired of me being like this and asked why it was ""just so hard to brush my hair and why I have to be a bitch everytime he asks"". I told him I was a bitch because I've repeatedly told him *I don't want my hair being fucking touched* and he accused me of being a lair. He says I'm lying because when he hugs me, his arms touch my hair. I tried explaining him that's different than feeling it up and inspecting it but he screamed at me and called me a liar some more and said I've never told him this when my hair was brushed. Which????

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve felt “dead inside” for the longest but now it’s a different feeling. It feels like I should’ve been gone by now. It’s an indescribable feeling. It really, really feels like I should’ve been gone by now. ",suicide

I’ll never be a functional person and I’ve always known it. I have been delaying the inevitable out of a mixture of cowardice and false hope but now it’s painfully obvious that there’s nothing left for me.

198909,"Gun or Train?I have two realistic options. I own a gun, and live relatively close to a train track. 

Loneliness, anxiety, depression, and loathing have driven me to hate my life. I feel like nobody loves, or even likes me. Those who ""do"" are forced to by societal things like being stuck with me in their family or school. 

Soon, I'll be out of high school and into college, and even more alone. I'm about to lose the people I've known for years in a couple of weeks. I'm really afraid that it'll throw me over the edge. 

Nobody would expect it. I'm a very happy, funny, but quiet person. Honor roll grades, strong opinions, and interests, plenty of hobbies too. I've tried so hard to improve. I just can't get people to like me how I want them to.

I've never had a boyfriend or girlfriend, and I'm already 18. This embarrasses me and is mostly why I hate myself and my existence. It's embarrassing. Shameful. Everyone hates me. 

A gun would be messy and ugly, and a train would be all that and the guilt of the conductor. 

I'm thinking of using a gun if I can ever get the guts to off myself. 

I don't have them right now. Maybe that's a blessing in disguise, but when I'm alone on nights like tonight, so fucking embarrassed by my pathetic existence - I really wish I could shoot my head off.

The sudden end of suffering. The permanent solution to the problem. 

I'm too patient to wait for ""my college friends"". I'm too patient to wait for ""luck"", or for ""people to find me"". Everyone else has someone at my age. I'm tired of being the odd person out. Maybe it's time that I leave the game once and for all.  ",suicide

198914,"It's been a very long 10 years...I'm a 22 year old female, and I was diagnosed with clinical depression at a (seemingly) young age. I've been to doctors, psychologist, counselors, psychiatrists, and therapists. I've been on 5 different medications for depression, 2 different medications for anxiety, and 3 different medications for insomnia since I was 12. I suffer from depression, anxiety, insomnia, borderline personality disorder, post traumatic stress disorder.
I've been called selfish, manipulative, beyond help, a brat, and pointless - by doctors and psychiatrists.
My mother once told me that if it weren't for my little sister having a learning disorder, she would've ended her life.
I sat in the car with my father before and had to listen to him talk about how, if he had a gun, he would've killed my mother.
I cause a family crisis, 4 years ago, of which my siblings and I had to stay home from school and have an emergency meeting with my counselor/therapist at the time - all because I asked my father for help in buying a car (he had bought my brother one) and he went on a rampage against the family.
My family won't help my mother, who's gas and electricity gets turned off every summer because my father won't help her pay bills while he lives in her basement.

I'm supposed to be getting married after I turn 23, and I think to myself everyday ""does he want to be with me really? or is he settling because he's afraid he won't find someone else?"" We both cheated on each other, which usually puts a red flag up to anyone who knows. I've been told my many people ""maybe you two shouldn't get married?"" But the problem is, I may have cheated on him, but it was purely physical. I am in no way interested in being with another man emotionally. I am not interested in other men that I meet, whether they're my age, older, or younger. I don't want to be with anyone else for the rest of my life but him...
But I ask myself, as I said, ""does he really want to be with me?""
I can't help but think he doesn't. I was his first ""real"" girlfriend and he was my first ""real"" boyfriend. We've been together for 6 years. He know's everything that is wrong with me, medically speaking.
But I don't feel wanted from him anymore.
He tells me he wants to talk to the girl he slept with... 
He wants me to go out with friends (which is a whole other story)
I'm not allowed to talk to my best friend of the last 6 years because he's the one I ""cheated"" on my fiance with years ago.
My best friend, who i asked to be my Maid of Honor, doesn't talk to me unless she wants me to do her hair (we met in Cosmetology school).
The only friend I had from work no longer talks to me after transfering to a different store.
That guy that was my best friend for the past 6 years, that I'm now allowed to talk to? He has made no effort to contact me what-so-ever. Then I remember him saying, about 4 years ago that to him ""everyone is replaceable"". Therefore, I assume I've been replaced.

I can't afford a cell phone, I can't afford car insurance, I can't afford food to keep in my apartment, I can't afford clothes, and I can't afford to pay my student loans.

I have high blood pressure, and am borderline diabetic.

I feel like I can't have children due to Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and the fact that I'm 22 and have never been to an OBGYN due to sexual assault when I was 12.

I feel like I'm living a pointless life.
I'm never going to be a mother.
I'm don't want to go old alone.
My own mother and father forget I'm around.
My brother wouldn't be phased if I was around or not.
My fiance would be financially stable whether I was around or not. He'd be free to talk to whoever he wants. He'd get my car to drive. He'd have an apartment and he has friends who could help him through anything. He has friends...

TL:DR I have suffered with suicidal thoughts for the past 10 years, have had the talk about my passing with my fiance, and know that my family probably wouldn't know I'm gone without being told. I feel that my life is pointless, and worthless. I feel that I deserve the pain I get dealt with...but my patience in running out. I have no friends (I wish I was exagerating) and my fiance would be financially stable with or without me here. I told a friend I was suicidal last year and she just stood there and stared at me.
I'm just about to give up on trying to be someone, on trying to have friends, on life.",suicide
198916,"Posted this on another sub. But now feeling far worse. 27 years in with friends like this, why try again?I seem to have a gift for alienating myself from people. Recently ive found I have lost a lot of friends because (I think) they've treated me badly and then im unable to get over it. Here are examples of how ive slowly found my friendship circles diminishing. (Sorry I'm aware this is going to get repetitive but the whole problem is that it keeps happening, and i dont know what i'm doing wrong):


1) - I was preparing to go travelling, and on the final leg of my travels, a friend and i had arranged to spend a number of weeks working (for our board) in spain. I went about my travelling and then as i arrived at the b&amp;b we'd be working at, he was proving difficult to get hold of. I set up expecting him to join in the next few days, and eventually he texts to say he cant make it over. he gives an excuse that i remember not really being sufficient to explain why he couldn't make the whole time. I then spend the next 6 weeks on my own working at this farm with people way older in a language I was struggling. I tried to make it work but it was bloody lonely........Skip to five years down the line, and we'd become sort of buddies again, and I stupidly suggested joining a local softball team. He's explicitly keen and we go about making arrangements to join. long story short he bails on me after Ive paid the deposit. I was furious- i had given him ample opportunity to pull out if he wasnt keen, but then he bailed once it was too late. I mean i joined the team and it was fine but it made me feel bloody rubbish. Do i keep trying with him?


2) - I was living in manchester with three friends from college, when i was offered a fixed term job abroad for four months. I found a fourth friend to take my room, quit my current job, with the plan i would return to manchester and get a new job- once it was over. I left, returned and moved back in, and then had a hard time finding a job. That being said, I always knew it would be a couple of weeks maybe a month or two to find something. I had money put aside and worst case scenario i was lucky that my family would help if i needed an extra months rent, and then i would get a bar job or something.
Into my second month of unemployment, im sat down by my housemates and they say they're worried about signing a new 12 month house contract if i dont have a job. I loved the flat i was in and being unemployed and fairly depressed at the time, the flat was definitely the best thing going for me. I say its fine ill take the liability and Ill take a bar job for cash if needs be. Worst case scenario I'd replace myself and move back home. Equally family would cover me for the months I'm there (again worst case scenario). Whatever happens id never have left them having to foot my quarter of the bill. It starts getting closer and closer to the time we think our contract needs renewing, and one girl is pushing particularly hard for me to go. We never had animosity, but she had only really been close with one of the guys (""B"") in the house and recently B had been thinking about moving out to live with another friend of his who was coming to town. As i see it, she wanted to keep B here, so was trying to get me out to allow B's friend to move in. B had been a good friend of mine. But he was happy to let this play out, since i could sense it would work out well for him if i went too. Apparently he had 'promised to his friend' that they would find a place/move in together. The two of them, B and her then set me a deadline by which i was to have a job otherwise they thought i should move out. All the time i was saying its just a matter of time till i find a job, and if this 'deadline' comes, I'll just take a bar job and pay that way. No need to kick me out, the money was safe. We weren't even sure the landlord was going to force another 12 months on us. Anyway this was all getting to me by this point, and I thought i had a job offer (that i didnt particularly want) but needed to have it confirmed. Also if it fell through i was back to square one. Just before this deadline however, my brother said he didnt think contracts worked like that, and whether i should check what the small print said. Somewhere in the contract that I had missed before said that after the initial 12 months (which had recently expired) the contract would go to a rolling one. As such- it wasn't automatically another 12 months, and the pressure was off- The 'deadline' by which i was to have to commit to another 12 months wasnt coming! We could pay by the month, and one month more would be more than enough to set me with something definite.


Two days later i got the job confirmed. After being unemployed for two months this was such a relief. However when the girl found out i remember hearing her crying. When i got home I just collapsed in tears, having been through the ringer (not just the recent months, it had been a hard year, and this was the topping). B and the girl - two people who had up till two months ago been in my tight knit friendship group, then moved out of the flat and the remaining housemate and i replaced them. But now i feel incredibly unwelcome in that friendship group (which still does things together), when two people tried to treat me like that. Do i give up on them?


(Oh actually to add to this one, after we realised it was a rolling contract rather than an automatic 12 month renewal, it turned out she had emailed the landlord privately to ask if he wanted a new 12 month contract.. We found out when he included all of us in the reply! She had tried to trigger a new one!)


3) School friend, main interaction now really is through a fb messenger group of school guys, some of whom i was close with, some not. anyway recently he had a bday party and when he first mentioned it i noticed i didnt get an invite on fb with all the info. previously weve been good friends so i figured id just been missed off the list. on the day of he mentions it again and i had forgotten about it, and then say on the group that i hadn't got the invite. he ignored it and the party came and went (thankfully i was busy that day anyway). I appreciate this one sounds like he actively didnt want me there, but theres not been anything to trigger that, and he's the kind of narcissist who wants as many people at his events, so i dont think it was that. But maybe it was. Either way, him ignoring me on the group whatsapp was fucking embarrassing, and now id be too proud to reach out to him again. Do i give up on him?


4) I'm writing all this because my birthday came past, and i realised how scared i was of inviting people to come, since my trust has been hurt so much. (there are two other specific examples that have kin but Im sure this is fucking boring by now.)
What am i doing wrong?
These people are all still in my life in some way or another, and a big part of my past. Do i forgive them when none have tried to apologise?


It really fucks me up that its possible to be so crap to someone, and then not see any repurcussions. They didnt lose friends over this. Clearly i dont matter to them.. ( esp example #2)..


Thanks if you read this far.

198918,"I want to stop thinkingLife has been very difficult for me for awhile. Lots of trauma and mental illness. I got out of an emotionally abusive relationship last year and in doing so alienated basically my entire social circle. I went from constantly having someone to play games with or talk to, to going months without any kind of real social interaction. I had never felt so alone in my life. 

I have a new girlfriend now (I'm a bi girl if that's relevant) and she's wonderful. I feel happier most days, but my depression is definitely still there and recently it's been getting worse again. Most days it seems like I'm okay, but once in awhile I just feel like the ground gives out underneath me. I think that the dopamine associated with the early stages of a relationship is beginning to wear off, and that's making my depression stand out a lot more than usual.

I used to want to die because life was too terrible to cope with. Now I'm just... tired. Life is hard and it feels like my brain is a computer that has been running non-stop for over two decades at this point and wants nothing more than to just stop. Consciousness is such a terrible and disorienting experience, and I can't help but just.. want out of it. Someone my girlfriend knows committed suicide recently. I try to be there for her and console her, but it's so hard when I'm in the same sinking ship. And of course being reminded that it's an option isn't conducive to my wellbeing, either.

I struggled with a drug addiction for a little while last year. The thing I really got addicted to was the feeling of blankness - of sweet nothing. I wish there was a way to flip the power switch on my brain for a little while, even for just a few moments of cognitive silence. I would give anything for just a few moments of complete existential silence.

My therapist said she thinks I'm a genius. She seems to have made it her mission to make sure I come out of all this alive, like she thinks I'm going to change the world when I do. I'm on the autism spectrum, and some people might call me a savant. I undoubtedly have a very bright mind, but it's so... tiring. Sometimes I feel like a monkey that opened the pandoras box of intelligence and now I desperately want it shut. I wish I would have been born as something other than human, I've never felt like I belong here very much. 

I dunno, this is just venting I guess. I'm going to try to not be another death on my girlfriend's mind.",suicide

198946,"Something to ponder regarding taking a life, even and especially if it's your own. New take on things.Might somehow trigger but it's not graphic. Bear with me if you will. Just gonna write this and hopefully those who can understand, will. 

I've been given some information that might be a life, mind and heart changer for a few of you out there. I'm pretty sure the knowledge is out there on the web, so whoever can pinpoint a search that will fetch this data, to verify what I am going to say, please do check. This is from Higher source, from the Supernals and from the Place called Heaven. God's abode. So basically, regarding suicide. Many of us have been in this exact situation of despair and wanting to die many lifetimes before. MANY. Some where, at some time - in time - something went awry in our lifetimes . Some force caused us to lose our way and become despondent. This caused to us to choose death over life. Know this - that at that time - we were singularly immediately BROUGHT BACK into this world. 

There was only a cessation of the pain for 2 minutes not less. It was not a reprieve. It was not an end to pain. It was a break. We were placed in a place called purgatory - in Hebrew it is called Kaf Hakelah. This is a place of Judgment. There we were told to return. No questions asked. Nobody put us in hell. We were not admonished. We were simply given a new body and a new life - to get it right this time around. Many times before we succumbed to the pain and chose again and again death. Our souls have carried all of this pain around with them for so many lifetimes. Which is why so many of us are so TIRED emotionally. Thing is we have NO CHOICE but to stay alive. We have to recognize that there is no leaving till we CROSS OVER the threshhold into the light of understanding in this world. We can't choose death any longer. It does not serve the Universe and serves no one or anything.

This wanting to die is a reflex - a knee jerk reaction of the mind but not of the soul. The soul wants to complete its mission. So it is now our job to stay on COURSE. Not to waver - and not to give in. No MATER what happens. Life is the only choice. And there are no coincidences. Whoever understands this, will understand. I hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears. That's it.",suicide

Everyday of my life has been a battle. I am in constant physical pain. I have had many surgeries and am at a point now where doctors just ignore me.

 My life is falling apart. In the last two years everything has gone to shit. Financially I have screwed everything up. My husband resents me even though he won't admit it. We are in so much debt we are going to lose everything. I blame myself for everything. I am the one that has put us in this position. 

In the past I would have held on to the love from him to get me through but that it gone. I would have used the logic of knowing my children need me, but lately my being around them just causes them pain. All they see is someone broken. I have no happiness. I have nothing. The logic is gone And how is that fair to them? They deserve better. They deserve more. I am in so much pain.

Couldn't and wouldn't tell me anything more than that. And she was gone. I feel like she pretty much just ghosted out of my life, which is essentially what happened. I'm always thinking about it. It's been almost 4 months now, and there's not a minute that goes by where I'm not filled with a range of emotions about it. It's tough, like my mind is stuck no matter how much I preoccupy myself. The relationship was to a certain degree emotionally abusive as well.

I guess through everything, I've lost my feeling of self worth. I feel like I've talked about my problems with friends and family to the point where I don't want to bring them up anymore in fears of pushing people away. I'm no longer confident in myself, my appearance, the way I currently behave (not talkative, just zone out thinking). I do most everything alone now, I'm not interested in socializing (I just make plans and end up bailing usually). I especially don't feel like I should be wanted or meant to be with someone, for how easily I can be discarded and deemed worthless. I don't understand how people so close to me can exit with such ease. Nothing makes sense anymore, and everything is just so painfully hard. 


Today was the day I settled on a plan, and to be truthful, it kind of feels, well, good. I've decided when I get to the place where I plan to make this happen, I'll either follow through, or drive to the nearest hospital for assistance. I'm not doing this to get back at anyone, or to make anyone feel like shit. I know this is selfish, I know how it feels to lose someone, but I don't know how much more I can really take right now.

198964,"My note. My plan.I'm going to put my thoughts down here.

The sections will be:

* Work
* Escorting and sexuality
* Drug and alcohol addiction
* Family
* Attention
* What I want
* The plan

**WORK**

I work as a software engineer. Well, I would, if I was able to hold a job for more than 6 months without the company getting tired of me. I'm good at what I do. My bosses love my output. I have open source projects and contributions. Even on my first programming job at a startup at 18, the CTO was shocked on my first day. Repeat that shock for every job. But the companies get tired of me because I have a reputation for coming in to work straight from nightclubs, drunk, drugged up, tired, needing to snort coke at work just to stay awake and productive.

**ESCORTING AND SEXUALITY**

As said above, I can't hold down permanent work. One nice thing I have going for me is that I'm a young, pretty good looking girl. I don't look my age. I look 15. Men love that. They get off on me being their little girl and them being my daddy who want to fuck their little hot teenage daughter. The sex is boring for me. I like girls. I went through a long period of not knowing if I'm straight, lesbian, or bisexual. I think I like men but only in the sense of having a ""daddy"". I have a real birth dad of course, but I want a ""daddy"" - that older guy who looks after me, loves me, helps me get through my early twenties, gives me advice. I suppose this is what people call ""having daddy issues"".

Escorting can go really wrong. Sometimes clients beat the shit out of their hookers. It's only happened to me once, thankfully. I got tied up in a dark room and beaten and whipped. On the positive side, getting beat up escorting builds character. It makes you really, really strong. I can take a ton of abuse from other people (but not in my own head).

**DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION**

It's debatable whether I'm a coke addict. I don't desperately need it, but I want to use it. Thanks to being a hooker, I get lots of easy and free access to cocaine. I use 2-3 times a week.

Alcohol is what will destory me. I used to be a teetotal, innocent, quiet, shy teen. Now I'm an alcoholic, confident, loud party-girl with an arrest record of ""Drunk and Disorderly"", ""Drunk and Disorderly"", ""Drunk and Disorderly"". I love vodka. I need vodka. I have two bottles in my fridge right now that I'm going to start pouring once I finish this letter. I'm having a quiet night in (been out 4 nights in a row now) so will drink myself to sleep.

**FAMILY**

They hate me for reasons I won't go into.

Shit, this is the hardest bit to write. I've been typing non-stop for 10 minutes and now I'm unsure what to say and hesitating.

My mum... she doesn't want me anymore. I know she doesn't, even if she says she loves me. She never shows appreciation to anybody for anything. My dad worked hard to provide for my sister and I (because my mum hasn't worked in decades, lazy bitch). My first memory of my dad was when he took me to a party that his workplace threw for the children. I was the shy one who was too scared to talk to anyone. He eventually dragged me out and into the car and shouted at me. I was a fucking disappointment, obviously not (yet) the outgoing loud confident child everyone would prefer. I wish they had just got a divorce instead of the constant arguing they've had since before I was born. I was desperate to move away from home because I couldn't take their arguing anymore. Now when people argue in public it still upsets me.

**ATTENTION**

It makes me happy. It didn't used to, because I was such an awkward kid and teenager. But now I fucking love being the center of the dance floor; the one up on the stage; the naked girl; the one guys talk to in clubs and pubs.

I was at a gangbang last night. I was there through an escorting contact. I was the first person to get naked and fuck. And then I just didn't put my clothes back on. Walking around nude and having the men look and me and wank at me was what I wanted -- attention. I wanted to fuck the other girl, though.

**WHAT I WANT**

A secure job. A better flat (my current place is a tiny studio). Not having to suck dick to afford things. Not having alcohol withdrawal symptoms after just 48 hours sober. A family.

**THE PLAN**

Obviously, because this is a suicide note, the plan is suicide. The question is ""when"" and ""is there anything I want to do first?"". Suicide has been the plan for as long as I can remember.

My first genuine suicide plan was two years ago. I was going to travel South East Asia, spend all my savings having fun and fucking hookers (haha, but I've become one! twist!!). And then die. That didn't get executed - instead I ran away to another place and just did nothing.

Like I said in the ""Attention"" section, I enjoy that and it makes me happy. So maybe I should just seek that out. I was reading a story earlier - http://longform.org/stories/little-girl-lost - go read it, it's good - and this story is about a girl who ran away to Los Angeles to seek out fame. She got the fame. She became one of the biggest porn stars of her era. Then she shot herself in the head at 2am.

Another thing I read earlier - http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/magazine/here-is-what-happens-when-you-cast-lindsay-lohan-in-your-movie.html - about Lindsay Lohan. She still gets acting gigs despite being a crazy bitch.

If they can do it, why can't I? I could run away to LA, Hollywood, whatever. I'd have a go at trying. I would be homeless but I have enough savings to last a year. If it doesn't work out, I can end it all. Finally end it all. It would be a relief from my stress and problems and this suicidal voice in my head that's taunted me for my whole life - which is ironic because I wouldn't get to feel the relief, because I'd be dead.",suicide
198965,"I don't want to kill myself, but I realise on a factual level that this is probably end of the line for me.I've been in poverty my entire adult life. I have severe developmental disabilities that have only been compounded by trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma.

Where I'm at now is just trying to take inventory of all my remaining options and stare at them until one of them looks more appealing than just up and dying but it's not really working. I have no family, about $500 in my bank account. The only way I ever make any more money is through e-begging and I just don't have it in me to do that anymore. I can't beg for my life while being accused of being a scammer and being stalked and having rumours spread about me and whatever else and then people get upset at me for not wanting to be super friendly and cheerful with everyone. 

All I want is a place to say I live, but I don't have one. I don't live anywhere. All I want is some sense of permanence in life. I have no income no home no family and I live in a hostel. My visa in this country runs out in less than a week and I don't know where I'm going. 

I don't know. Maybe I do want to kill myself after all. I've just been keeping myself drunk for days and days because this is just too much for me to handle emotionally. I don't even drink but the more killing myself starts to look like a genuinely viable option on the table...

I just don't know. I'd rather die than put up with any one of these problems anymore.",suicide

198975,"I think this is it.So to start off I've been in a relationship for nearly 2 years now, it has had its really great moments and it's really down moments as all relationships have. But now I think it has to a point where it won't come back. Just small things overtime building up to a point where she feels like it's not worth it? I'm not sure. Overall I feel like I've been given up on. I think that over the course of the relationship that I've been given unreasonable expectations. Probably because  for the longest time, I would do everything I could, give it all I had to make it work. It might of just become an expectation now that I would always go to the enth degree to make it work. Like any person I've made many mistakes before, some big some small, always working through it, but it's different now. Now I think that no matter what I try, not matter what I do it wouldn't change anything and that makes me sick to my stomach. Overall I can't say that I've been unhappy with my effort in this, I think I gave it everything I had. 

I've tried to end my life twice before this, the second nearly infront of my partner, but I was pulled from the tracks and somehow we were still together after that. I promised never to do it again but I guess I just suck. After I realised that I probably can't fix it everything just clicked. I know what I want to do. I know that if I was to keep on going I would always live with so many 'what-ifs', so much guilt, dread and pain. That's not what I want.

I don't blame my partner for this, this line of thinking is definitely not her fault. The plan I have is what I want to do. I don't want pain, I don't want to look back at what was a great person and think to myself that I wasn't good enough or that I blew it. I just want out, to tap out, to stop. It's what I want.",suicide

One, we'll call Marie. At first, we were amazing. The best of friends. We really clicked on a lot of things, and even made plans to live in the same apartment next year. Eventually, however, it became clear that I was only a placeholder for her true goal: having a boyfriend. She told me flat out that ""you will never be as important to me. I'm here to find a person to marry."" She's a real peach, as I'm sure you can tell. She only is around when she needs something and only is able to ever talk about herself and how **horrible** her life has been. But she thinks she's a godsend, and when you're not actually needing support, she's happy to tell you she'll always be there because she's such a great and giving person.

The other girl, Aspen, got really mean one day for no reason. Turns out she was a compulsive liar and had fabricated EVERYTHING she ever said for the first few weeks. It was really bizarre. She is honestly the only person I can say that I definitely *hate*. 

Anyway, I have been dealing with some major clinical depression for a long time, but it got so much worse in the last few weeks. I have been running a mile every day and trying so hard to meet people and make new friends, but it's just not working. Friends were always really important to me, but my friendships have always ended badly. Tonight, I broke down. My roommate is gone, and I am all alone. I texted Marie and said ""Please come sit with me. I have never been so alone."" And she replied that she simply didn't want to, and plus she had some homework. It was pretty feeble, as I have the same amount of homework as her (of course, we're in the same classes) and plus, it's a Friday night. And the worst part? Everyone else on our floor is wrapped around her finger and it's pretty clear that she's spreading some rumors about me. I really really don't know what to do. Especially since I am set to live with her next year (at least it's a 4-person apartment!)

I know she's only making it worse for me, but right now, but right now, even this is better than being completely alone. I have just been crying for the last few days, at the drop of a hat. I don't have the energy to go to class, and I have never felt so alone. Please, I need some advice or just some love.",suicide

198992,"So it's been over a month since I tried to hang myself. (very long)The evening before this happened, I was having a very hard time at work emotionally speaking. It seemed as though every little thing was setting me off: too many packages coming my way? Rage. Running all around the warehouse to fetch something for someone? Anger. Dealing with my cousin on the phone? Let the waterworks flow forth. It was at that time I made the decision to end it all. I was finally going to do what I had talked about doing ever since I was a little kid. There was no turning back. All of the frustration and heartache I had been dealing with in my life finally came to a head. 

It had been several months since my grandmother had passed on and I had made the decision to sell her house and start life on my own at 28 years of age. But let me tell you, nothing in my life had prepared me for this moment. I had lived secure in the knowledge that she would be around for a good long while and that by the time she was ready to go I would have my life either figured out or I'd be long dead before she got to see what a waste of a human being I had become. But then the Pancreatic Cancer hit and for two years she lived with the specter of death looming overhead. For the first year things were great: the Chemo was doing the trick and she looked to be in great health despite knowing that the Cancer was a death sentence and all we could do was stave off death for as long as we could. But once it stopped working and her tumor markers crept back up, that was the beginning of the end. Seeing my entire life slowly crumble in front of my eyes while I helplessly watched this all unfold tore me apart. She was all I had left; The last vestige of familiarity in a world I was vaguely aware of. I thought that maybe she would somehow find the strength to pull herself up out of this dark abyss and find the resolve to get herself well again. But in the span of literally one week, everything deteriorated so fast I couldn't believe my eyes...

I woke up that morning with a resolve to hang myself with my belt when I got home from the gym. I walked in the door and first took off my belt. Where to do it? The doorknob was way too low and I didn't want to burden my lower body with that awkward angle. Ah!  Here we go! I tied a big knot in the end of the belt and shoved it in the door frame and made sure it would stay like that, grabbed a small stool and dragged it over. 

This is it. I finally had come to peace with my destiny. I could no longer run away from it. This was in my blood; in my DNA. Driven not by consciousness but by pure genetics. My mother tried to kill herself twice in the span of one year. Once with a gun (she shot herself in the stomach while she was 7 months pregnant with me and it almost killed me in the process) and the other with a handful of pills. I remembered the story of the second time she did it: her father found her on the kitchen table with the empty bottle near her hand. They rushed her to the hospital, pumped her stomach and as soon as she was well enough, threw her in the Psych ward for several days for observation.  I even reminisced about when I was 18 and was talking to her mother on AIM. At one point she was cross with me about driving to see one of my cousins whom I had only heard about in passing my whole life. It then escalated to her telling both my cousin and myself that she wanted to kill herself and that we wouldn't have to deal with her anymore.  I had a feeling she would not go through with it but still it gave me pause. Now I know where my mother got her suicidal tendencies from.

So now I wouldn't have to burden anyone with my mediocre life, of always trying to be someone I'm not. Of always having this lame part-time job, never being the big tough sonofabitch both my father and grandfather were, never getting to experience the joy of having someone fall in love with me and having friends and worthwhile life experiences. I would no longer be a disappointment to myself and others. I would finally be rid of it all. My grandfather used to say that people who were depressed and got help were weak. I didn't want to be weak. Not to him. But enough was enough.

I wrapped the belt around my neck while standing on the stool and kicked it away. As I hung there and things started to go numb and dark, a flicker of something in the lower part of my brain screamed at me... ""WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING??"" I then frantically reached for the stool before I could pass out and regained my footing.  I stood there gasping for air and finally realizing what I had tried to do. I cried for what seemed like an eternity until I had no more tears left. I took a few breaths, looked at the belt I had thrown to the floor, said to myself, ""Well shit..."" and made myself some breakfast and went about my day as if it had never happened. 

I wish I could say that I had had an epiphany and resolved to better myself for both my benefit and for my family. I wish I could be like alot of the others on here who have tried this and used it as a big wake up call to figure out what went wrong in their lives but in my case that is not so.  I am still quite morose, although I will not try anything like that again. I am still stuck in my shit job but I am trying my best to continue on with my hobbies, if for nothing else than to keep the bad thoughts away.  I am still very much alone and will always be so. I am finally coming to terms with that aspect of my life. I'm still a pretty lackluster individual and will always be one but still... With all that being said, I may not matter to anyone but myself but right now I'm all I've got left so I'll have to make the best of it.

I have no idea why I wrote all of this out. I guess it's just my way of telling someone that I'm still here and that I (hopefully) won't be going anywhere anytime soon. ",suicide

My morning started with me waiting for (as it is tradition in our house) the ceremonious walking-in-singing-a-birthday-song (""heute kann es regnen"", for the german folks here). After an hour, which felt like four, my door opened and my whole family walked in, carrying a tablet with a present, a candle, and a cup of hot chocolate with marshmallows (don't judge me, I live hot chocolate with marshmallows). Being the goofs they are, they of course messed up the lyrics and put some playful insults in there. (again, common practice :D) After that, we went downstairs to the breakfast table, where my sister had put a list of choices for the day, starting with my choice of breakfast. Of course, I checked every one of them, and had a fried egg on pancakes with maple syrup, baked beans and bacon. (Except for the one hundred year eggs my sister put on there with the plan of ""putting something you wouldn't choose"", she knows me well) in the afternoon, there were choices too, ranging from yoga, to community games, to taking a walk. I chose control games and a walk. (however it was stormy outside, so we ended up just playing games like mario kart and Codename) 
For Dinner, I had choice between a few things, but I ended up choosing sushi and bubble tea, because heck yeah! We also watched a film, and after we were done, my family (my sister) decided to introduce me too a German tradition: beer. So, beer tasting was on the board, while playing drinking games.

It was nice to be there for the kids like I needed someone years ago. 

I should be okay, but I'm not okay. Ultimately, my brain feels ruined from the years of physical and emotional abuse I dealt with. I was excited to live the rest of my life as the gender I really am, but now that I no longer get misgendered and the hard parts of transitioning are over, I have a void. I have nothing I'm working towards. Nothing to distract from the deep pain I carry. 

For a while it was college, then working, moving out, transitioning, but what is it now? What is so monumental that it can take me away from these shitty feelings. Everyone tells me I did it - time to relax... but I'm just so sad. My emotions are hard to control. I think back to the years of having awful things said to me, being blamed for my parents almost divorcing, ect.

Why have kids if you aren't going to love them unconditionally? Like what the fuck is wrong with people.

Every night this past week, with one exception (Thursday night), I went out driving around looking for a place to Long Drop that's the perfect distance from a hospital for every vital organ except my brain to be saved.  Long Dropping is a method of hanging where you fall so far that the rope snaps your neck, rendering it almost completely painless; but not far enough that your head decapitates.  It's the method of hanging that was used for official executions in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Unfortunately for normal people without special apparatus it can be logistically tricky setting it all up right.  I'm pretty tall and I need an unimpeded vertical space of 14 feet within which I can drop.  What's more, I want to make sure the ambulance arrives on the scene RIGHT as the 6 minute mark passes (the point of brain death).  This way my organs have the best chance of being harvested for other people's use.  [https://www.cicm.org.au/CICM\_Media/CICMSite/CICM-Website/Resources/Publications/CCR%20Journal/Previous%20Editions/March%202016/ccr\_18\_1\_010316-37.pdf](https://www.cicm.org.au/CICM_Media/CICMSite/CICM-Website/Resources/Publications/CCR%20Journal/Previous%20Editions/March%202016/ccr_18_1_010316-37.pdf) estimates 30.6 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved over doing it in my apartment (which has such a drop).  That's a big deal to me.  I don't want to live, but there are plenty of mentally healthy individuals undergoing critical surgery, who are loved and needed by their families, friends, spouses, children, communities, employers, all of whom desperately want them in their lives - and who themselves wish to continue living.  If I have perfectly functioning organs untinged by drug abuse or medical issues, why shouldn't I give them that opportunity???  I want them to have the freedom to continue their fulfilling lives as greatly as I desire the freedom to end mine.

&amp;#x200B;

So around I went through the southern neighbourhoods (Colonias) of my city, in the dead of night, keeping an eye out for any stiff horizontal beams onto which I might tie my knot.  Not to do it there and then, mind you; my baby sister is still in undergrad exam period, and I still need to visit the States one more time to probate-proof.  I was just in the research phase.  I soon realized that the climb itself was a major consideration, and that while I could have a ladder shipped out to anywhere, it'd be much easier and less suspicious to drive up and scale it on the spot.   Isolation and the correct distance from hospitals were also key.  This effectively whittled my options down to an abandoned water tower in Miramar just south of where the main city starts, and the various unguarded transmission towers even further south.  (All the towers in the main city are cordoned off from access, but the newer and poorer districts haven't had that luxury.)

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday or Wednesday I bought some measuring tape and on Friday night I bought a rope from Home Depot - again, just to see where it hangs.  On Friday in the Colonia Arcoiris I find the PERFECT string of towers, way in the outskirts of town and absolutely enormous, their legs lifting them a full 30 feet off the earth.  What's more, they're on a dirt road specially made for transmission tower access - there's NOTHING there, just towers and weeds.  Most of the other towers here, I have to watch out for passersby, cops, cameras, not to mention how hard it was to get a clean drop with zero obstruction from lower beams.  But the Arcoiris towers have joints with nothing under them but bush and bramble, anywhere from 10 to 30 feet.  I find the leg with maintenance footholds and hoist myself up to the first beam that I deem high enough, where when they cut the rope, my body would still fall a good 8 feet into the bramble.  I love climbing and heights and it's exhilarating being up there.  I think about my secretly suicidal middle sister (who doesn't know that I know, I snuck through her high school diary one day) who's taken up rock climbing as an adult.  I know exactly how she feels and what she's been plotting all these years.  The first thing I think is how tight would it be to climb the whole damn tower, see the entire city from 200 feet above.  The second thing I think is Damn I wish I had her skills.  I wonder if she failed once and took up rock climbing so she would know exactly how to do it the second time.  Then I wonder if rock climbing gave her a reason to live.  Being able to climb that whole tower might give me that reason, although I'd probably get thrown in jail or deported.

&amp;#x200B;

Reality set in.  I had work to do.  Trembling, I tied the rope to a beam at 17 feet.  I knew if I fell that night I would wind up in a hospital and be asked a million questions not to mention my plan would physically be fucked for months.  Carefully I clambered back down.  My fall would be clear, alright; I just needed to trim the tops off some bramble.  This was simply the perfect place to do it.  At last after nights of scoping the ghettos, I had found my spot.  I couldn't help but keep admiring how perfect this tower was.  At last.  It was just perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I heard a truck roar past.  I'd parked on the side of the dirt road.  That's funny, I thought, obviously that's not a utility worker.  I remembered there being some abandoned looking signs and fences further down the road.  Maybe they weren't so abandoned after all.  Then I heard the truck roar back.  Stop around my car.  I saw lights.  Blue and red ones.

&amp;#x200B;

This wasn't good.

&amp;#x200B;

You really don't want to mess with the police in Mexico.  Actual criminals, at least the ones I've encountered or heard of, don't care about civilians.  It's not Brazil and they have bigger fish to fry than kidnapping gringos.  But the cops, you have no idea what they'll be up to, who they know, or what they want on any given night.  Every single interaction I've had with them has been them stopping me for no reason, questioning what I'm doing, searching my pockets, or trying to rob me.  I'm out here all by myself in the prairie with the Estatales.  Do I have my Bitcoins with me?  I'm pretty sure I left my flash drive at home, it has all the real goods.  My laptop's still here.  In any case, this is bad.

&amp;#x200B;

'Hola, que pasa?' I shouted.

&amp;#x200B;

'Que pasa contigo?'  What's up with you? one of them asked.  He was younger than me and slightly built.  His partner was older, gruff and thick-set.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just walking around, exploring, I said in my best attempt at casual Spanish.  They tell me to put my hands on the car and separate my legs.  Holy shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I do so.  They pat me down and proceed to ask me whether I have drugs or am drinking.  Whether I'm there with anyone.  I assure them I'm alright and I'm just out, touring around like a dumb tourist.  No particular destination.  I live in Centro and I work online doing computer stuff.  Here are my IDs.  You want to search the car?  Be my guest.

&amp;#x200B;

The younger guy starts talking to me, as the older guy walks off to the tower with a flashlight.  We're here to help you and protect you, because at this time of night, there are some bad people around, and we want to make sure you're not in trouble.  I'm not, I say, I'm doing just fine.  I just like walking around seeing what's out here.  Facially, I'm cool as a cucumber; mentally I'm scrambling to figure out how to explain the rope still tied at 17 feet to his partner when he returns.  I know the truth will get me 5150'd immediately, possibly deported.  Don't these guys have drug dealers to catch? I think to myself.

&amp;#x200B;

To my surprise, they let me go without further questioning.  'I strongly advise you to go back home,' the young guy says.  I nod, pretending to pretend to understand.  What's your name? I ask.  Brayan, he says.  Have a safe night, Brayan.  They drive off.

&amp;#x200B;

Whew.  That could have ended a lot worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I return to the tower and resume thinking.  I'll need to practice tying that knot.  I'd be better off buying a bike lock with the rope pre-attached and draped around my neck, so I can just clip it on.  That way I can try out the strength of all materials at home.  I have plenty of space.  My biggest fear, bar none, was fucking up.  Being a cripple for decades, prevented by well-wishers from ever doing it again, being forced to lie in bed or drink through a tube.  That could not happen and would not happen.  I could always decap from a pedestrian overbridge I knew downtown.  But it would be so ugly for my parents.  Not to mention the first responders.  No, I had to do what I could to drop hang.  And that meant dealing with my fear of falling and retrieving that rope so I could measure out its length from the knot point.

&amp;#x200B;

Just as I was about to climb back on, I heard someone pull up slowly behind my vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

I quietly strode back to my car.  The real bad guys this time?

&amp;#x200B;

It was the same cop, now with all lights off.  I stretched out my arms.  What? I demanded.  You know it's kind of weird, you guys coming back here like this?

&amp;#x200B;

No, the weird one is you, the young cop said in English.  You're the one being weird.

&amp;#x200B;

I just think I left something back there, that's all.  Something fell out of my pocket... My measuring tape.  I tried looking around in my car but I couldn't find it.  

&amp;#x200B;

The young guy said he'd go with me.  Erm, what kind of gun is that you got?  An M-4 (assault rifle), he said.  You know I don't have a lot of money on me, I said.  Don't worry, he said, we're here to help you.  We're here to make sure you're alright.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my tape measure, on a rock, a few feet from my rope, and swiftly turn around before he could ask any awkward questions.  I immediately get in my car and say, Thanks for your help, Brayan.  Have a good night.  Ignoring the troubled expression on his face, I drive off ahead of them, happy to be alive.  But only so I can tidy up my estate and bequeath my Bitcoins so I can come back and kill myself in a week.  Of course.  But happy to be alive nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

When I get home after 20 minutes, I notice there's a truck driving very, very slowly, several blocks behind me.  I turn around to stare at it.  Presently it approaches where I'm standing.  It's a police truck.  It speeds up as it passes me, but I distinctly see Brayan and his partner through the windows.

&amp;#x200B;

It dawned on me that even the scumbag Mexican state police was for some reason fundamentally and sincerely invested in preventing my death.  Had I explained that it would save hundreds of lives in Africa - not to mention ameliorate the exploitation of thousands of their own Mexican countrymen in the fields and factories - they would still have 5150'd me.  Had I explained that the only thing they were doing is forcing me to decap, or even worse, ruining the postmortem donation value of my organs, they would STILL have 5150'd me.  I'm 100% sure of this.  Sure, it's called doing your job.  Sure, it's called a protocol.  But somebody high up in the ranks of the police force decided to include my life in that protocol.  Decided that I should not die so that others may live.  Decided that the proximity of my death to that community gave it more weight than the deaths of labourers and farmers in Mexico and Africa.  Decided that my organs are worth more together than apart.  All without knowing me and everything that's wrong with my evil soul.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter its consequences, the thing I intend to do is detestable and absolutely unacceptable to society; everybody is going to do everything they can to oppose it.  What Brayan represented was the implicit rejection of my desires by Western society.  I saw through his words and actions that no one will ever trust anything I say, regardless of how jovial or relaxed my mood appears to be.  In fact there is an invisible barrier of distrust separating me from every other reasoning functioning human being on earth which no amount of logic or ethics will ever break down, no matter how indisputable and obvious it becomes that the world will be a better place if I'm dead.  I've tried to hire people to help me, to no avail.  I met a couple, boyfriend and girlfriend, who both claimed they supported voluntary euthanasia, the right to leave this life with dignity and choice.  But when it came to a specific person, me, they could not even be paid to help.  It's like I've become a place where logic itself frays.

I'm from Ohio, friend is from Washington, we know each other through our parents who met in high school. Needless to say, we don't see each other a whole lot since we're so far away, but we go on vacation once or twice a year with our families. I've known her my whole life but I became friends with her a couple of years ago and we now text or talk every day. We have been in a mutual friend zone about as strongly as can be and although we are very good friends there has never been anything even close to going beyond that. Also, she is bi, and from what I can tell leans towards liking other girls more than guys.   


We were on a vacation in Montana, a pretty typical outdoorsy 5 day vacation for us. I'll call my friend E. The first three days were typical -- fun but not much to talk about. But for the last two nights we stayed in a hotel that gave us extra rooms because our reservation or something was messed up due to COVID. Anyways, I got my own room and E and her sister, L \[14\], got their own room. Since my room had two beds (well, sort of, a queen bed and a pullout couch that was basically a single bed), they wanted to have a sleepover type thing. This isn't unusual on its own, we're comfortable with each other and whatnot. 

The first night we all played various games and watched some TV for probably about an hour before L fell asleep, and because E and I weren't tired we went to sit on the couch bed. We read through old text conversations (between ourselves) on my phone and at one point she put her elbow on my shoulder like you would put your elbow on the window of a car to rest. This was definitely pretty unusual, as we aren't touchy people and the only physical contact we'd ever had was fake hitting each other or wrestling for something, like a phone. Anyways, at one point we got to some photos that she sent in messages and she tried to take my phone so we wouldn't look at them, but I pulled it away and basically ended up lying down on the bed trying to keep it away. Usually at this point she would just give up or maybe reach around to grab it, but she just laid on top of me with one hand on it and eventually gave up, but didn't move, and rested her head on my shoulder/chest for what was probably half an hour before it was super late and we both decided we should try to get some sleep. We slept for maybe an hour (in separate beds) before someone made a loud noise in the hallway and we both woke up, although her sister somehow slept through it. E came back and sat above the pillows and played with my hair for a while, which was also unusual. Then she said she was tired and crawled down into the bed and just laid next to me for the better part of an hour. Keep in mind that this is an extremely small bed and there was nothing comfortable about this from a needing to sleep perspective. Then her sister started to shuffle around and E jumped up quickly, and at that point we were all up and went about our day. No mention of anything at all, except for one point in the morning where E made some awkward compliments about my hair and eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

The next night was the same situation, except L fell asleep much faster and E came over to my bed again, and this time put her head on my shoulder pretty much right away. We were both very tired since we barely slept the night before, and she laid down again next to me and said she was tired and asked me to put my phone away, which I did. We laid down for a while until she said she was going to go sleep. She also patted the top of my head when she said this which was an interesting gesture and I still don't exactly understand that. Anyways, she sat up and then gave up on standing up and laid back down, and about 10 minutes later she did the exact same thing and eventually got up and went to sleep. Notably, every time her sister kind of shuffled or the door creaked or something, E sat or stood up, so she clearly didn't want other people seeing what was going on... 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been over 3 weeks since the trip, and while we've texted every day as usual since, there has been essentially no mention of these nights except for her saying that she misses the pullout couch bed because ""it was comfortable."" I really cannot stress enough how nothing like this has ever happened between us before, how even a year ago her accidentally brushing my leg made her say ""ew."" Also of note, I didn't really initiate any contact or anything. I went along with it because I didn't mind at all, but she did initiate basically everything. I really just don't know what to do now. The last thing I want to do is jeopardize a good friendship, but I am also curious about why she did what she did those two nights.

I don’t care if I fail but, honestly I’ve been hurt so much by people’s selfish behavior that now the only thing I find worth while is fighting against that type of behavior because of how much it pisses me off. Had people steal, lie and betray me so many times, and I hate people seeing people lose there faith in humanity due to these cruel sick bastard’s. IDK any of you but, I am staying here to make my mission to fight against this, as I know how it feels. 

These people stole from me when I was just 16 year old kid who had dreams of making people’s lives better and this turmoil with them when there true colors showed, just solidified my original mission even more. 

Living filled with genuineness and love is a much more  peaceful anyway, I’ve noticed. No one I think will read this maybe two people but this is just a journal to my self. I can’t let these people win, I have to serve justice to them, and try to spread a positive influence in the world no matter how small.

I know most people find like trying to save the world and making the world better like cliche but it’s honestly true for me, cause honestly, who wants to live in a world where we’re all trying to make the world worst? No one wants more pessimism, it’s all suffering.",suicide
199046,"just a small rant about my school life and grades I don't normally comment or post rants online (yes this is my first rant) because I never had the guts to (I was always too afraid for that) but right now I feel like I really need an outlet for my thoughts and feelings because I am running out of people I can talk to and seek help. I don't want to talk about this to my parents because I do not want them to be overly worried about me, I don't want to talk to my friends because 1. i know some of them don't know how to respond to me and don't have enough experience and 2. i also don't wish to bother them at this point of time. So I've seeked reddit for help now. 

School for me hasn't been going well, I have just ended my school year recently and my grades overall have not been up to my expectations (tho I have already gotten over with my high expectation problem haha). My school calculates their grading system by using MSG, which gives grade numbers to subjects: the lower your grade number average, the better your grading. I had a score of 2.167~ and honestly it isn't that bad imo. 

However I realised that because of this score, I was not able to take as many subjects as my friends could, and was not allowed to take many advanced subjects (in fact the school rejected my application to two different advanced subjects) due to my own score. I needed a 2 or lower to get into many different opportunities the school provided, but because I screwed up one test, I completely lost my footing and fell down to a 2.167, and essentially lost everything right in front of me. These ambitions I had and opportunities the school provided just vanished over a day and my world crumbled away. I didn't know how to feel and I was utterly destroyed inside. What's worse is the feeling of moving away from my friends (which I never had a lot to begin with which makes me treasure them even more), my friends all have excellent scores and have these opportunities that I didn't manage to obtain and are all progressing quickly, and this makes me feel even more alone and sad than I normally do (this is why I don't want to talk to them at this point of time). (Honestly I don't know how I'll be able to cope in the future because we're going to be changing classes next year and I'll likely be  drifting away from my close friends due to my scores) My close friends are taking a program together, others are getting advanced subjects….while I have absolutely nothing. No special programs or advanced subjects despite working so hard for the whole year. Because I screwed up once. Essentially all my effort for the whole year has all just gone down the drain and I feel completely wasted and just useless. it's that feeling of trying so hard that you burn yourself hard for the longest time, then losing everything you've worked up to in a second. It makes you feel like a nobody and that your efforts don't matter. Despite pushing yourself forwards and mentally+emotionally breaking down countless times, everything adds up to nothing. You are just...nothing. 
i have just been in a state of rejection and blankness recently and I don't know how to move forward.

I feel like some of you on reddit would have been in such situations before, could you give me a bit of advice on how to move on from this moment? And thanks for listening to my whole rant haha, I just needed a place to vent my frustrations D;",non-suicide

I didn't know that parents didn't throw heavy objects at their children when they wanted them to shut up.

My parents are amazing and want to help and support me any way possible but I always feel like I let them down and I feel like they are always hateing me even though I know they aren't.

Theorem (Rank-Nullity Theorem): Given finite dimensional vector spaces V, W, and a linear map f: V -&gt; W, dim ker f + rank f = dim V.

Proof: Let {v\_1, . . ., v\_k} be a basis for ker f. We extend this to a basis {v\_1, . . ., v\_n} for V. We now note that since f is linear, {f(v\_1), . . ., f(v\_n)}spans f(V). However, f(v\_1) = f(v\_2) = . . . = f(v\_k) = 0. Thus 

{f(v\_{k+1}), . . ., f(v\_n)} spans f(V). We now show that {f(v\_{k + 1}), . . ., f(v\_n)} is a basis of f(V). Since it already spans, it is enough to show that it is linearly independent.

Suppose not. Then there exist a\_{k + 1}, . . ., a\_n, not all 0, such that a\_{k + 1} f(v\_{k + 1}) + . . . + a\_n f(v\_n) = 0. Thus since f is linear, f(a\_{k + 1} v\_{k + 1} + . . . + a\_n v\_n) = 0, and hence 

a\_{k + 1} v\_{k + 1} + . . . + a\_n v\_n is an element of ker f.

Thus since {v\_1, . . ., v\_k} is a basis for ker f, there exist a\_1, . . ., a\_k such that 

a\_{k + 1} v\_{k + 1} + . . . + a\_n v\_n = a\_1 v\_1 + . . . + a\_k v\_k

or, alternatively,

a\_1 v\_1 + . . . a\_k v\_k - a\_{k + 1} v\_{k + 1} - . . . - a\_n v\_n = 0.

As we have assumed that not all of the a\_i are 0, this shows that {v\_1, . . ., v\_n} is not linearly independent, hence not a basis. Contradiction. 

Thus we must have  {f(v\_{k + 1}), . . ., f(v\_n)}, and hence a basis. Thus 

rank f = dim f(V) = n - k = dim V - dim ker f,

and hence

rank f + dim ker f = dim V.

QED.

This proof beautifully illustrates the power of well-chosen definitions. By defining basis, linear maps, and dimension properly, we get a very useful result that is at the heart of much of linear algebra. It also showcases the powerful (though sometimes misleading) technique of *proof by contradiction*, wherein one shows something is false by assuming it is true and deriving a contradiction.

This proof is not a hard proof, I rederived today it after not looking at it for three years. It is, however, somewhat long and involves many steps and ideas from basic linear algebra.

This is also not the only proof of this theorem. There are others, one of which uses quotient vector spaces and is almost identical to the proof showcased in #2, with a few details changed. But I wanted to show you guys something new, that showcases other powerful ideas.",non-suicide

I have sliced my flesh open. I have hung myself from a tree. I have suffocated myself. I have prayed every single night not to wake up.

You cannot just go to therapy and think you’ll be better, or a hospital over and over. Even when I’ve put my faith in everything it just isn’t working.

This virus has taken away the pool this year, drastically impacted the way I do my job (all I do now is answer an email now and then ), and made it so I can’t see my niece and won’t even get to meet my nephew when he’s born in a couple weeks.

I am on the autistic spectrum and have tried to kill myself before.

Basically as the years go on, my friends have drifted off from me. 
Mainly because I feel I am too much for them and they all have relationships.

The one thing that always make me think about suicide is being alone. I do not want to be one of those 40 year old men who spends all their time alone. I know for some people, that would be great for them but for me, it' a no. I'd rather just end it if I know that is going to be my life from now on.

I know my issue may sound silly but hey ho.

Sometimes I feel ignored by my friends and I'm starting to question if they want to even be my friend?

I also have ADHD so I can get really hyperactive sometimes. 

Plus I am struggling job wise and I if I do not get a more permanent job soon, I'm going to have to go back and live with my parents which will cause me to be alone even more.

So basically, I've decided to give myself to new years. If nothing improves and I do have to end up going back home. I'll end it, no one would care anyway since everyone ignores me. They probably won't even notice.

This is the day that's been waiting for me. Time to let go. I think it fitting, to leave the earth on the same day I was brought into it.

I've tried for so many years to get better. This cesspool of self-hatred, anger, envy, and general feelings of self-hatred have been slowly welling up, day by day. I can't take it anymore. There's really nothing left for me now. 

There's a certainty within me that the people I call friends and family will do so much better without me. One less piece of scum ridden from the earth. Already many have commented how distant and much colder I've become. I'm losing them. I'm losing me.

I'm done with this. ",suicide
199194,"My girlfriend hints that she wants to kill herselfHey reddit. Something has really caught my attention recently.. So I've been dating my girlfriend since Halloween 2017, we've had an amazing relationship and I'd have to say that she's the greatest person that I've ever met. We've had so much fun together going places, on dates an thinking of our future and basically doing anything and everything fun that we can think of that we have the money for and or want to do. 

So, we're quite a weird couple. She has her ups and downs and so do I. When I say weird, I mean basically every type of weird. She literally just texted me saying ""Huh. I just thought about how my mom grew my vagina in her vagina"" We have those cute moments and are really comfortable around each other (very comfortable) 

Our relationship was basically spot on perfect for the first three months or so when we first started dating. We talked nonstop and still do to this day, we practically never run out of things to talk about. The difference now is, we argue a lot more :( My family is Christian and quite religious and she comes from a family of non religious people. Now, me myself I'm not as into it as let's say my mom is. Every once in a while I'll go to church with my family but I'm definitely not a saint by any means.. That's where this really all started. (Somewhat)

We were both virgins, we lost each others virginity together and needless to say, it was awesome. We were careful and never got caught. However there was this one night that she a metal wire bra on and it was hurting her after wearing it for a while. We were comfortable enough in our relationship that I said it would be okay to take it off while she wore a hoodie over it so she could get more comfortable while we watched Supernatural :).. Big mistake..

The day after, my mom came into my room for whatever the hell reason while I was at work and saw my girlfriend's bra on the floor and flipped out. The next time we were hanging out at my house my mom burst into my room after she was here for a while and started interrogating the both of us, screaming about underage sex and sins and stuff, mainly at her. That brings me into the other thing that  you should know about my girlfriend..

She's adopted. Her birth mom was on many drugs when she was giving birth so she was born with a few things wrong with her. One, she has small little seizures if she doesn't take medicine for it, and two, she's quite bipolar. Me myself I am EXTREMELY bipolar, probably worse than her, but after being ""parented"" by someone else's mom and being screamed at by MY mom of all people.. It definitely pissed her off. She said some things about my mom over text, not to her at all but to me. My mom then for some reason decided to go on my computer and read all of our texts. You can imagine how that went. MY mom wants her to apologize for saying that she is a bitch and my GIRLFRIEND want's my mom to apologize for getting in her face and for a multitude of things that would take me a long time to explain.. So basically this whole conflict arose and she is no longer allowed at my house and no one in my family likes her :( 

She lives about 40 miles away from my house so getting there and paying for gas is quite difficult for either of us. Whenever we want to hang out, it's either I drive my car and I hang out at her house (which I haven't been able to do until recently) or she comes to me and we hang out at the mall or in her car.. This needless to say isn't really normal relationship material but we love each other very much and weren't just going to let my religious parents stop us from dating. However, it gave her a LOT of stress as well as me. The difference between the two of us is she has a lot more depressing history that has happened to her compared to me. So the stress affects us two very differently.. I can handle it a little better than she can. 

We've been arguing about money, about if one of us puts enough effort into the relationship and it's gotten so serious to the point of threatening stop talking for a while.. Now, oddly the only time we argue is over text when we haven't seen each other in a while. In person, a lot of people say we're ""goals"" or whatever teen shit they say that makes me cringe aha. The TL;DR is that we're pretty happy in person and we're a great couple. 

Now, when I say that she's had some tough past, I mean this.. I've mentioned that her mom was on drugs when she was born, she had to live with her birth mom for four years of her life and it wasn't good. She now lives with Her birth mom's foster mom and she's a MUCH better mom. However she's an old lady and her adoptive dad is no longer around.. Which I had to be there for her when that happened. When she was little she wasn't treated well by her birth mom, and when she was young she was raped.. She has a history of cutting and severe depression because of the seizure medicine's she's been on and has extreme mood swings because of the depo vera shot (birth control).. I've caught her cutting twice and made her promise that she wouldn't do it ever again. She's very hard to argue with as her dad was a lawyer and she thinks that facts and evidence are more important than morals. I'm kinda just rambling now though.. 

For about a month or so she's said multiple times that she's thought about killing herself and that my mom would be happy, and that I'd get over it, which I know that I wouldn't.. Not for a long time at least. She says that she's been blank and doesn't feel anything at times. I want to help her and although I make out our relationship to be amazing, I don't want this to accelerate into something that I can't help. She doesn't have friends that talk to her and she lives out in a farm house with no neighbors and is alone for most of her time. She's already out of high school and hasn't started college yet. Maybe college will help but that doesn't start until September.. I want to help her, sometimes I just don't know what words to use, the hormones in her make her change moods really quickly and we could literally be talking about what makeup she should buy and then she'll turn it around into an argument. I don't want her to end her life.. It's probably not as serious as my anxious self makes it out to be.. But I want to help her.. I really hope she doesn't mean it..",suicide

199211,"Worthlessness,depression,suicidal thoughts. How do i move on?Here is some background in regards to my life :
Junior High school = Tried to be as social as possible, imitated style of popular guys, totally ignored school, had relationships and sex all the time, was very immature, started working as a pr on clubs for a couple of years with success. Had sex on first grade.
High school = was well-known among st people around me, still ignored school, became intrigued by history &amp; philosophy &amp; theology thus started reading on books related to plethora schools of thought, started working and working out every day for an entire year and felt the sense of achievement, wanted to become a personal body trainer-nutritionist.
After high school = jobless for 6 years, went to the army because it’s mandatory for 9 months on my country, stopped everything related to well-being, became depressed, couldn’t handle the people on the environment because I thought everyone was mindless and not a good person inside. After the army, I engaged on gaming for countless hours, I went to study programming but this specific school had no future. I completely ignored it. Switched to major psychology on a university. All went well in the beginning but then I ignored it once again since I was living with myself and had no control of myself and I didn’t discipline myself. I lost 1 year because of that. Then I passed the module. My relationship was toxic as hell, I lost the confidence with myself and gradually I became anti-social. I feel very awkward in social situations with people I do not know and I was the entire opposite a few years back. I keep many things for myself since I was betrayed by people around me. I feel very lonely nowadays. I lost my best friends but unfortunately it was not my fault. I wish none of that happened. My ex best friend A has a demeanor of a child. He has been very supportive throughout our friendship but he lost his father. I was there for him but since then he has been raging on me over meaningless matters. He always tries to belittle me. He knows I would do nothing to retaliate from his actions, he understands that he is on the wrong but he still does it. My ex best friend D is a sociopath with feelings of grandeur. He belittles everyone, mocking the girls around him, mocking his friends. He wants others close to him to do his bidding. He is a racist thinking that a white privilege exists and should be enforced on the world. He thinks so high of himself that he doesn’t take the time to criticize his actions and words or even see how others are feeling and why they act the way they do. He thinks he is God Almighty. Another ex best friend of mine called G is literally a psychopath. He had me as a friend over the years just to exploit being with a “good” person and feel like normal only to toss me on the garbage once he left where we lived to exploit his family which is rich. My ex girlfriend  of 2 years was an angel. On our first month. Later on she started being Over jealous of everyone, even my friends. Luckily, she doesn’t have feelings of grandeur but she has so many problems that one can’t even handle them. She is afraid of death, afraid of talking anything in regards to science, afraid of people around her, afraid of the entire world. She things everyone is a bad person. She is very depressed. I have been there for her through our entire time together. It is not her fault but since then, she fed me only with sorrow. She started fighting with me everyday, throwing tantrums for unimportant things 2,3 times a day. And still, I was by her side the entire time. But then I couldn’t take it anymore and I told her that it’s over. A few months later, she started messaging me. Being the sensitive and protective idiot that I think I am, I returned by her side but not as her boyfriend. Only as a close friend. We meet from time to time, and talk with each other almost everyday. She still is depressed, talking about how bad the world is. My father doesn’t love me, he never said “good job” in my entire life. He is unemotional. My mother does, but unfortunately I can’t talk with her over complicated matters. I have a brother, around 12, which plays games every day through his day, and has sociopathic traits. We cannot communicate. I do not believe in Jesus or a deity to guide me in life. I see all the injustice on our society, and why a person wants to overcome the fear of death by believing. But i do believe in Buddhist teachings. Which i stopped following because of how i feel. Lately, I am surrounded by feelings of worthlessness, depression, and suicidal ideation. I truly have no one around me. I have been spending my time on things like anime, series and gaming just so I can get my mind off of real life. I fell so bad about who i am and what i have achieved, which is nothing. I feel like I will fail university again. I daydream a lot. Being away from the capitalistic society which markets the way of life i despise, living peacefully on nature, providing on a community living outside the norms, peacefully, or even to become a Buddhist monk. But I don’t know where to start, where to continue the path of my life, how to act.  I truly feel, on the western society everyone is faking their friendship and attitude. I am 24 and i feel i lost a portion of my life. I feel like i am frozen. I fell it's too late. I feel like i don't have a sense of purpose, a sense of belonging.",suicide
199212,"Kyle, just because you’re shy or socially awkward, doesn’t mean you’re an introvert Why is it so hard for people to realize that being that type of person doesn’t make you an introvert? 

Just because you are someone “easy to talk to” doesn’t mean you’re an extrovert either.

An introverted person is someone that gets highly drained from social interactions, and an extroverted person is one that gets highly drained from being all alone. 

If you despise talking to people and feel constantly drained after spending time with them, then you can consider yourself introverted.

Because you dislike events with a lot of people you aren’t an introvert, as a matter of fact, not all extroverts like huge parties filled with people.",non-suicide
199213,"Is this what it means to grow up?
I guess my question/title boils down to the fact that I don't feel happy anymore. I can have good moods, but I don't get that rush of joy anymore. Like everyone else, I assume, I used to get these little burst of happiness when I would think about stuff I was looking forward to, almost every day, and sometimes lying in bed I would just not get up and get small pangs cheer or joy thinking about the good stuff in life.


I haven't felt that in a year. They just stopped. First the lying in bed stuff and then no bursts of happiness. I started smoking a lot of pot, got more anxious, and then eventually had some serious trouble and it all just went away. I started getting panic attacks and then here I am, trying to reassure myself that I won't kill myself, struggling just to not feel awful.

So back to my question, is this what growing up is? I used to think the ""happiness"" would come back one day, but then it dawned on me that it might be gone for good. I thought that trope about adults all being deeply miserable and unsatisfied wasn't true, but I guess it is.

199218,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at timesI have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I...I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life.

199219,"I can't take much more, please help meFor starters, i'm a 15 year old guy and i can't cope with my depression much longer without losing it. I've only been like this since July of last year, but it worsened very quickly. I hate myself and every aspect of my life. I can't stand to be around anyone i know anymore, but i've gotten used to pretending to be fine just enough to be believable. I stopped cutting a month ago because it was too much of a struggle to hide. Nothing that I used to use to cope with it seems to work as well as it did. I used to drown out my thoughts by playing guitar, but that lost effect. Even with music being the thing i've looked to my entire life, that barely helps anymore. I regret almost anything i do even if there's nothing wrong with it. I used to be an A/B student, but now i'm failing one class and barely passing some. Sometimes i'll just sit in my bed hoping pandora will play something to fit my mood while i think of things like how i could kill myself, or what songs i want played at my funeral, or even how people would react when they found out i was dead. I hate just so much as listening to people talk and laugh. And to top this all off i became extremely avoidant to the point where i mostly only talk to my parents because it's mandatory. I don't know anyone that i trust anymore. I know you're going to tell me tell my parents (they don't know, but are suspicious) but i can't do that. Trust me i've tried. I secretly have an unexplainable hatred toward my few friends so they're out of the picture. And i tried my youth pastor, that wasn't even worth my time. I don't like talking to any of the rest of my family either, and there is no way in hell i would ever talk to someone at school. I go to one of those ""suck it up and go on with your life"" schools. That and i have i have a strong hateed toward all of the teachers and the place itself. So in a nutshell, i have nobody to turn to, but i know i need to be on some kind of medication or at the most even in a hospital because i feel like that would comfort me somehow. I know this is long enough already, but there is a backstory to all of this. Last july i went on a trip with some people from my church to kentucky. I was never ""mr religious"" but i was basically forced to go. Back then i enjoyed life. Everything was fine back then. Skip foward some, a girl i sort of knew went, but at the time that didn't mean anything to me. Throuhout the week i slowly and quietly got to know her, all without ever saying anything to her. By the end of the week i didn't feel very well and i could tell my mind wanted something to do with her. But this is where it all went downhill. My naive self knew what infatuation felt like, this wasn't that. I didn't care what she looked like, i loved her. I started talking less and less and shying away whenever i could. On the way home i just felt wrong the whole time and could barely keep from crying at times. At home nothing felt the same. For the following months i just got deeper and deeper into this emotional abyss. Nothing except for her could or can please me almost at all. When i had my wisdom teeth removed they gave me oxycodone. I used that to forget about things for a while, but around my birthday in september i hit a breaking point and took what was left of those pills and i could feel my life slipping. I apparently passed out, but no one knew. I was surprised i survived. It worsened in december when i went to some concerts in tennesee, because she was on that trip. I've attempted suicide once more since then but i didn't even get close that time. For a while when things would get frustrating i would just pop about 20 ibueprofen, i still haven't had a problem from that. Now the only thing that's changed is my hatred toward most people. I hate social settings and even talking to a small group. I barely sleep at night because my mind is racing. And all i think about a lot of the time is how she'll never love me because i'm ugly and to self-centered and just not good enough for her or anyone. I hate myself and i don't know how much more i can take before i snap. There are only two true cures: her or death.",suicide

For the last few days I've been researching a lot about DMT and psilocybin. Many say they can rewire or reset your brain. And I was able to put my hand on some psilocybin mushrooms. Ate them all.

It felt like taking a deep dive into my consciousness. I couldn't stop thinking. I was thinking so much I didn't know what to think of anymore. I started imagining myself flying around earth very fast to find a place where I could finally be happy again. I could not find any so I decided to fly away from everything, in that part of space there's only darkness. I was looking for the end of it. Then i think the effect started to fade away, and I was slowly going back to me lying on my bed.

When I opened my eyes, I realized I was starving to death (I didn't eat for days), and I was able to think of all the food I used to love, and I wanted it badly. I went to the supermarket, got it all, and when I started eating, it was like the very first time I ate these things. It was fucking delicious. It made me feel so good I even started to play some music, and here again, it felt like it was the first time I listened to it. Even touching my hair felt so good and soft. It was like I was born all over again.

One day later, here I am. I feel much less suicidal. I have hope. I started eating again, and I feel like traveling again. I don't know if the feeling will last, but at least it's giving me a huge boost to escape this hell.

My quasi-joking manner is an effort to mask the pain of knowing the delusion of insanity.

See, I believe that people have this grand idea.  ""Let's make a post, perhaps on reddit.""  It will be for the lulz.  Hur hur.  Someone will get the message.  Especially if his name is George.  Yes, that is me.  Of course.

Yes, I do not want to live anymore.  This is why I am posting here.  I think people are facking liars.  I think you are probably a liar.  Maybe you are not.  But, what am I to believe?  I know she was a liar on some level (my ex, that is).  I know that she was under the spell of the relative of said person.  So, among other reasons, this was too much for me, and now its over.

I do not want to die because it is over with my ex.  I want to die because of the lulz.  Because of the diner.  I hate going to the diner.  What it means to me, to go to a diner, and see the lulz in action, to see the connection to my redd-ality.  

Are aliens real?  I see this little alien dude in the reddit log.  So let's talk.  How else could it be?  This is the only logical reason I can see.  Aliens must be real.  People do not have the time.  Or do they?

I cannot explain it.  But I can explain this.  I Want to die.  I will not do it.  I too scared to follow through.  Perhaps, thankfully.  Why?  Because I am still alive.

But, the insanity is too much.  The people do not give a shit.  You might, because you see someone in pain.  But, it is not so simple.  See, I want to die because, well, what I have seen is a mystery.  Knowing that I do not know, and that I will likely not ever know, is too much to bear.  Maybe I could accept Jesus, Allah, or someone.  I have no facking clue.  Maybe I should accept technology something else.  I don't know.  

But, I know that I am in pain.  I would ask for your help, but I do not need it.  I just need to try to understand for myself.  Why?  Is it just a mental illness?  Not likely.  I observe.  Theorize.  My observations are based on reality.

I would like to say thank you, and to those 'other ones', fack off.

199244,"I Have Everything Going For Me Except MeI have a wonderful spouse and a good-paying job.  


But I'm intensely unhappy. I'm fine (not content, but not overly sad) for about a month, but then I got into a dive. Each dive is 1-2 weeks in duration, and I eventually have to find a new hobby that gives me enough dopamine to pull me out of it. I have to tell myself some kind of lie like (this is my new calling) to protect my fragile ego from it's utter small and valueless existence.  


It's bad because each dive is worse than the previous. I've always thought of suicide as selfish and people ought to just own up and see a therapist if things get bad, but now I understand. Every sink gets worse. This time I've started thinking that hanging myself would be cool (literally cold and refreshing) and serene. You would pass out and then die peacefully. Might wind up in hell though, wouldn't that be a twist? End it all just for it to be worse on the other side.  


During this dive I experimented with choking myself with a scarf to see if it would hurt. It was uncomfortable but it did not hurt. It was actually a little funny because the pressure made my face look chubby in the mirror.  


In college people really liked me and I road tripped often. But everyone graduates and moves out of this shitty town, except me.  


And that's part of the problem. There's nothing left. I walked on the campus today but it's not fun without friends. My spouse is a great person but very different from me and I have to be the fun one.  


We don't have a good social network. GOD, FRIENDS WOULD SOLVE ALL THIS SHIT OVERNIGHT. But people suck, the few people in town just leave me on read, and their unreliability is not worth my attention.  


I want to get a job where I am respected and listened to, and I want to move to a place where I can make friends in a town that supports hobbies I enjoy.  


I don't want to see shrink because I don't want them to 'win'. I also have never made my own doctor's appointment and HR person at my work is a total bitch and I don't have anyone to ask about the insurance. Plus I just don't have the motivation.   


For Christ sake, I took today off work so that I could apply to jobs in a low-pressure environment, but I was too crippled by psychological angst.  


I am a very funny and creative person, but I'm in 0, FUCKING ZERO social circles where people appreciate me. Everyone thinks my energy is annoying. I go to work in a cubicle every day. My boss checks in maybe once a week. There is no natural light. I have no social hobbies. It's been this way for almost 3 years. I just want to die. Every time I try to help myself I just can't do it. AND THATS THE FIRST STEP ISN:T it???? But I can't even do that.

My life is one of wasted gifts. At one point or another, I've had everything I've always wanted. But I destroyed it all. I had close, loyal friends. I had the woman of my dreams, the one I should have married, and who desperately wanted to marry me. I had a career path that others would kill for.

I had everything I always wanted. But that wasn't enough. I had to have more. I lied, I cheated, I manipulated. Truthfully, I don't know why. In one way or another, I poisoned everything in my life. I ruined loves because of what... Lust? Greed? I don't know. I just know I can't stop. I am a monster by nature

All I know is that, without fail, I make every live around me significantly worse. That's the only truth I can always come back to... I make the lives of those around me worse.

Now I have nothing. She, rightfully so, left me. What few friends I have left do so out of some sense of pity. My job hangs by a thread, and the only way I can go to sleep is by drinking myself into a tired stupor.

My parents raised me right. They raised me with some semblance of chivalry. That I'm the shining knight, meant to slay the demon and save the princess. But what if I'm not the knight? What if I'm the demon, and the princess hates me? Isn't it right, even logical to still desire to slay the monster? Wouldn't the world be better off without one more demon? Isn't the most selfish thing I could do is expose others to my corruption? 

I had an attempt a few years back. It failed because of a stupid reason and the only reason I haven't tried again is because my parents, for foolish reasons, still love me. They'd be hurt. And that's all that stops me.

Most nights I spend with a bottle of scotch in one hand and my glock in the other, weighing my parent's pain with the pain that I inflict by continuing to exist. I know that the greatest gift I could give to the world is spraying my wall with my brain matter. My parents would eventually understand, right? 

I'm sorry.. I'm rambling. I don't even expect anything here... I just... Want to say this, you know? Maybe for others reading, maybe just so that my family has something to read to put it into context when I finally pull the trigger.

I’m a 24 year old male (who looks 19-20) among a large group of 30-50 year old blue-collar trailer-trash tattooed man-children who spread rumors and cause drama for no fucking reason other than being bored and disappointed with their lives and wanting to take it out on “punks” (their words, not mine) like me who are just minding their own business and trying to get through the day.

I’m supremely disappointed with the caliber of people I am working with, and within a few short days, I have lost my faith in humanity entirely. One of the few reasonably polite men (who has been working there for 20 years) has been bullied into submission by his coworkers. They belittle and emasculate him at every turn, and he takes it all with this sheepish grin on his face and a “boys will be boys” attitude.

I lie here awake tonight in my bed knowing that I have to get early to go back there for another 10 hour shift in the morning, and the only thought comforting me is that I could kill myself if things get really bad there.

199263,"Why not...? Part 2Hi reddit,

i've [posted a few months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bzj1c/why_not/) and just wanted to give you an update. **There's no danger**, so please don't worry. I really tried to get a better more livable life, but it just won't work. I know it's only been 4 months, but you have to take the 10 years before that into consideration.

I still have brutal headaches every single day. In the last 3 weeks they have been even worse, because i started a 20 week internship that every college student here has to go through. Being very close to people every day for 9hours is horrible for me. The constant ""do they think i'm stupid?"", ""what did that strange look mean?"", etc. drives me insane. I just can't concentrate and pretty much stare at program code for 8 hours without being able to read/comprehend anything.

I tried pretty much everything you people told me to do. I went to three new medical doctors and got my whole body checked and all 3 results showed nothing an unusual. I'm way healthier than most people at my age. Now that's some fucked up irony, huh? They gave me a bunch of different useless pain medications and the names of some psychologists that i already visited and one that i don't want to visit, because he has a horrible reputation.

I exercise again. I still run/swim/cycle for more than 10-20km two or three times a week and it doesn't help much. It relieves my headaches a little, but it's barely noticable.

I even tried massages for 3 months, twice a week.  It helped to make my wallet a lot lighter, but other than that it didn't do much good ;).

Between all that good and healthy stuff i had some fun and did whatever the hell i wanted to. Parachuting, driving to the Italy because a buddy wanted to camp and drink at the beach, riding rollercoasters in an amusement park on ecstasy and acid (holy fuck that was an experience!)... Believe it or not, i actually had a threesome on camera, if that counts as starring in a porno. That was all fun while it lasted, but the second i was lying in bed, it all was gone again. The insomnia is/was, as always there (5 hours of sleep in the last 4 days), and the next day was/is as horrible as always. Now i'm completely broke and the thought of going to another country right now is pretty much on hold. I'm stuck here for a long time.

As i've mentioned i started my internship and damn it makes me hate life even more. No matter how hard i try, i won't be able to do any kind of job to have a decent kind of living. It doesn't matter if it's freelancing or a regular job. Just the thought of something forcing me to work drives me insane. I know how stupid this sounds, but that's just the way it is and hey, it's my life.

I went back to the only medication that seems to help: weed. I'm high right now, because i'm sure this day would have ended bad without it. It's the first time in 4 months and damn it feels good. Most of the things i wrote have been written down before i got high, so please don't think it has anything to do with that. But you know what? My lawyer called a few days ago and told me i have to be in court in a couple of weeks and he's guessing i have to do regular drug tests and pay a hefty fine! This is such a fucking joke. I will need to get a second job just so i can pay the huge fine for the unbelievable crime of smoking and owning a plant, that is harmless when compared to alcohol and cigarettes, in the comfort of my own home. No growing, no selling, just smoking and owning around 3gram of weed. Fuck that, seriously. There's no way i'm gonna pay and support that corrupt, idiotic system. But of course that's not all. They will bully me on a regular basis with their drug tests and if there's even a slight discrepancy i will lose my driver's license.

My ""friends"" are pretty much gone. We had some small adventures in the last 4 months, but after trying again and again i realized i couldn't have a serious conversation with them and pretty much stopped talking to them. It's better that way.

Last but not least, i talked to my sister. She had holidays for 4 weeks and it was a ""good"" timing. She was not as shocked as i suspected her to be. She knows i've been in pain every single day for such a long time. We talked for a long time and both cried, but at the end she understood it, at least to the point where i know she could handle it. She doesn't want me to see unhappy, in pain and struggle every single day. She said if it is the only way i can be ""happy"", she won't stand in my way.  It was so horrible to talk with her about all of that, but it looks like she knew how desperate i was and why i turned to her with such a horrible thing.

I know how i would do it. I already tried it on on some different materials and even metal burned away like it was paper. I'm guessing the only thing that will be left of me are some really small chunks of burned teeth... scattered across a huge area. There's no way anyone would stumble upon anything of my body. That takes care of the problem that somebody could find my body and be scarred for live. I'm almost a bit proud of my contraption. Wow, that's a morbid thing to say... :D

I still can't think of a reason why i should stay alive. There's really nothing keeping me alive anymore. Thanks for reading all that stuff. You people are awesome. I've said it at the beginning of this post and i'll say it again: there's no danger of me killing myself, so please don't worry. I just needed to get these things off my chest again.

199274,"I just don't know what to do anymoreI want to preface this by saying I do ***NOT*** have a plan right now. If I did, I would go to the hospital. I've been through this before, so I know the drill. I also have not started self-harming again. 

Years ago I struggled with depression, and it culminated into me trying to OD. After staying in the hospital's psych ward, I was released and paired with an awesome psychiatrist who I have seen since. Things were good on my new meds (Prozac), and it was fine until the beginning of this month.

It started with just depression habits. Not eating (I've lost a little under 10 pounds in 3 weeks), lack of energy or motivation, all that. It's not that I don't want to eat, I'm just not hungry. I forced myself to eat a sandwich when it first started, but it didn't stay down long. I've just been occasionally snacking on crackers. I also have no motivation to work on my music. I have canceled all future gig bookings, but I have been attending the ones that were booked before all this happened. Honestly, it's one of the only times I forget about my troubles when I perform, but at home, I can't bring myself to work on music. I'll just sit in my little studio corner staring at the screen thinking ""I'll never be good enough at this"" and ""Just give up and use your time on something else."" It's an obligation at this point. 

Today it hit a peak. I was driving back from a gig, and I had the usual thoughts of being a burden to my friends and the fact nobody would miss me, but there was a new thought near the end. ""If I turned the wheel right now I could end it. I could be free. I'd go right off the fucking median divider, and it'd all be over.""

I'm terrified. I hadn't had a thought like that since before I was first committed. I have an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist on Wednesday and Tuesday I have one with a therapist at my college (if you are an enrolled student you have access to licensed therapists free of charge), but there's still tomorrow. I can't tell the school therapist about it too since they have to alert the ""proper authorities"" if I mention suicide, whatever that means. I'm over 18 and know the drill about involuntary commitment, so I'm assuming it's police.

I've talked to a friend about it kinda. She doesn't know all the details. I don't want to burden her with them. She knows my Reddit account which is why I'm using an old alt account.

I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to lay down in bed and sleep. I have shit to do though that I trudge through every day with a fake smile. I know I'm seeing a psychiatrist on Wednesday but three days seems like forever right now. I have given my gun to my father for the time being. I know suicide is an impulsive thing, and any barrier to something I can use is good. I told him to hold on to it for a few days while I clean out some stuff. He and nobody else in my family knows how I feel.  They can't. I'm stuck in my own mind until Wednesday. I just need to get this off my chest.

Edit: additional info, none of my friends besides that one knows what's going on. I've been pretty good about masking my emotional state, but I'm starting to looks physically different, probably due to the lack of food and sleep. My eyes have very pronounced bags under them and my face just looks kinda sagged. I've been telling people it's allergies. ",suicide

Through the years I have taken SSRI, SNRI, NDRI, Tricyclics, and 5 ECTs. None have worked. From what it looks like, my situation will only get worse. Like 1 year ago, I could not imagine that I would be in such a terrible place that I am now, or that I could feel so shitty, and I had already tried to end my life 2 times back then. It's like, the sadness in my chest is exploding, I can't contain it anymore. I have to wrestle with the idea of suicide every morning that I wake up and every night that I go to bed. More than a decade of dealing with 'mental health professionals' has resulted in nothing but disappointment. I had to quit my last 3 jobs in the last 5 years. About 4 months ago, I had to completely give up on working since it's impossible to deal with sadness while working, hell it's impossible to get out o bed. Dealing with friends and family also has always made things worse. Whenever I show a sign of depression they can't help themselves but to call me a loser or spout something to the effect of  ""why are you like this, what the fuck is wrong with you"". Through the last decade I have tried everything that my idiot friend have suggested: yoga, psychedelics, working out, hiking, traveling, etc.. through all of them I feel incredibly bored, stupid, disappointed and sad. There doesn't seem to be any option left other than suicide. I just want this sadness and disappointment to end, I don't think I can take any more of this. ",suicide

I've started to appreciate the ideas of Ted kaczynski, aka the unabomber, who was a Stanford professor that became obsessed with the idea that technology had ruined everything. I agree with him. Technology and maybe a few other things is what led to this mass unemployment/welfare state we have now. When people can't get jobs and don't have the opportunity to be a contributing member of society, they inevitably feel like their lives don't matter and enter a suicidal death spiral. I dropped out of high school due to bullying so obviously my job prospects have been minimal. I just wish we could go back to the ancient past, like as far back as mesopotamia.

199285,"Realizing you dont have anybody to fall back on sucks.Falling on hard times makes you realize how important a good support system is. Someone to call to rescue you to from a bad date, soneone to bring you food when your sick, someone that will let you cry in their lap when you need to. It hurts so fucking bad when you have no one to call or text to help you with these things.

99% of my online friends have been temporary and in real life i was always by myself or on the outskirts of a group. Hardly anyone ever really tried to get to know me.  And i ended up rarely feeling like i fit in. Always the ""shy girl"".

My depression has been getting worse lately after being better for several years. Ive struggled with it for 7 years now. Now if anything even remotely bad happens I just think about killing myself. I'll be looking at how ugly i am, or looking at a bad grade, or i'll just feel alone and I'll silently just wish i was dead. It seems easier.

I know it gets better, ive felt it before. But sometimes it is hard to keep on keeping on. Dont know what the point of this is but maybe it was relatable for some of you? Thank you for reading.

My husband does [this](http://i.imgur.com/wiU4f.jpg) to me about a few times a year when he really gets sick of me.

199288,"Disturbance in the force...I have been contemplating suicide since I was about 10-12 years old.
I have recently achieved the milestone age of 25, an age I thought I wouldn't make it to. I have never really stopped thinking about killing myself, except in the brief instance of a romantic encounter that distracted me/made me feel whole again. No relationship has worked out in my life. I have a child I am unable to raise due to irreconcilable differences with his mother... I am constantly fluctuating between ups and downs, and I use life as a distraction from the unending sense of impending death... 

I know that my mind is powerful, and capable of complex creative genius, however, I feel like it has been poisoned through years of shit I have fed it... I have never been one to complain about life, only myself. I think human beings are amazing, and capable of so much beauty and achievement... I am however, unwilling, and honestly I am un-able to resolve the difficulties in my life to satisfaction. I love my family, and i don't know how not to hurt them.. I have friends who love me, but they too don't understand how I feel. I have tried for years to express myself through art, music, poetry... I keep failing to connect. 

The intelligence that is the internet astounds me, the dark, sickness that is the internet, or simply humanity also astounds me. I am depressed... I am tired. I just can't follow through, and I always slip back into the same old shit. I am scared, but willing to die. I cannot see any point in continuing. Maybe there is some enlightening thought or perspective I have not considered... But nothing seems right. I'm done ranting. I don't know how long I will keep trying to fight this fight, but life shouldn't feel like this. I know it shouldn't. Maybe it's a failure to adapt, or just a jaded outlook that never seems to clear fully. I'm too down to brush my teeth, I don't shave, and now and then I just do something completely stupid to see what will happen. I don't want it to end like this, but i don't know how to make it different.

We had been together about three and a half years, half of that time apparently he had spent mentally checking out of the relationship while I was just falling more and more in love with him. We still live together, for the next few weeks, anyways, and I am trying to hard to get along so maybe things can be somewhat like they were before, but I am so deep into my own depression and anxiety or possible bipolar disorder that I can't even act like myself. I am paranoid that he is sleeping with all girls he has contact with, even though logically I know that is nothing like him. I'm making all these crazy accusations and literally just acting so out of my mind because I have no other way to cope that it's easier to just fight and let him pay me attention that way than it is to be passive and meager and sit in the home we have brought together and seethe about the situation.

I do not want to kill myself. I am actually scared to. I am logical and fluid and sensible, despite the depression. But I feel like that is the only option at this point. He just wants me out of his life, and while I know that doesn't mean I need to kill myself, I feel like that's the best thing for me to do because I am driven by relentless compulsion to just be on his ass all the time and I am ruining his life. 

I've struggled so hard with being ""crazy"" and being physically sick, and I am so grateful that he gave me the strength that he did for so long. I've had three things that have had me holding on this long : him, our dog and ""our""/my nephews. He's gone. I know he'd take care of the dog if something happened to me. My nephews are small enough that they would not remember me, and I would specially detail that I did not want them to know the truth about me until they were at least adults. I am literally out of things to hold on to. I love my friends and family, and call me selfish, but they are not enough.

My depression is much worse at night, and I actually don't tend to feel like this during the day very often, but I've noticed that it never really leaves now. I'm not my normal self during the day anymore. I had a dream the other day that I walked off a bridge. Instead of having that sinking feeling in my stomach, I had a feeling of relief, and that's how I know it's almost my time. 

He promised me we could have one more good day together before I left. (I'm supposed to be moving out and transferring schools.) Not sure when that'll be yet, but I think that'll be my last day.

Where to begin?  I guess I'll begin with myself.  I'm a male in his late 20's who's always been attracted to girls from the ages of 10 and up, I've had a crush on women who were 50 or so, but the further they are from 10, the more difficult it is for me to find someone that age I'm attracted to.  It's very rare I find someone 35+ attractive, ill find many girls 18-24 attractive, and pretty much every other girl 10-18 attractive.

When I was 21 I met a girl who was 11 that I found attractive and she was a wonderful friend (I don't drink or do drugs and was a positive role model in her life and influenced her not to drink or do drugs even though her two best friends were). I hung out with her, her older sister, and her mother for a few years.  When she was 16 (which is the legal age where I live) we started dating.  Id been saving myself for the right girl, and after we started dating she became the only person ive slept with.  We had been dating up until she finished high school and I proposed to her and she said yes.  She was never one to like diamonds or expensive things so I got her a fairly inexpensive but pretty ring that I thought she'd like.  

Apparently for the next couple months she just started feeling unsure but talked to one of our mutual friends about it, not me (even though we used to share everything we were thinking to eachother) so I had no clue she was feeling this way.  We ended up getting matching tattoos of an inside joke from when we first met.  Get closer to Christmas and starting university, she said she needed some time to figure herself out which I was okay with except when I realized she wanted to hang out just as much, just not be intimate at all.  Having waited so long to be with her,I grew a little impatient.  After an argument the Sunday after thanksgiving, I dropped her off at her dads.

A week later she told me that she had cheated on me and slept with some 40 year old guy from her college.  I had a mental breakdown and immediately went home, packed my stuff, and went on a road trip across the country that was going to end with me killing myself.  I had my phone though and talked to her and supportive friends.  She was really sorry and still wanted to be with me so I thought I'd try to make it work.

Once I started getting better dealing with it she tells me she never really felt engaged and I spend more on my hobbies than on her ring (even though she never wanted an expensive ring in the first place, she's a very thrifty person).  This just gives me a mini meltdown but not much happens.

We continue to try to make it work because we've been best friends, but its just sort of going along.  We decide that if we find anyone else we'd rather be with, that we wouldn't keep the other back.  She left to work for the summer across the country.

A week after she leaves I go on vacation with my family and I start having suicidal thoughts because a combination of her leaving, stress from work, the fact I saw a bed bug on my bag and already had a panick attack from when i got bed bugs from my girlfriends familys apartment right after I found out she had cheated on me and those were the most stressful bugs I've ever dealt with, and because my hatred for myself for liking younger girls and I kept seeing cute girls.  I had gone for a walk during vacation as well and walked by a park where a bunch of different groups of college and high school students were hanging out and I felt like such an outsider, remembering when I hung out with groups like that and missing that and meeting new people.  So Memorial Day weekend I come back.  During the plane flight I'm thinking I'm probably the only person who would be glad if we got into a terrible accident.  

Monday I'm home alone.  i could have called my friends but for no reason just start hating all of them so i get helium, a plastic bag with pull string, and try to asphyxiate but I freak out.  I pack my bag and prepare for a motorcycle ride across the country because I can't stand being here anymore.

Tuesday morning I get ready for work, can't decide if I should kill myself, go to work, or leave on a road trip, and I freak out and go to my parents and tell them my suicidal thoughts.

I go to the ER and get committed to their psychiatric ward which is probably what I needed at the time.

The first day I just feel really out of place and mostly keep to myself.  I notice a really cute girl but like normal dont have the guts to talk to her.  Finally I feel brave enough to and we spend the next day drawing, walking, sharing our problems, talking, and playing cards.  She's 19 and had glasses and I think she's super adorable and develop a giant crush on her, it's always been so easy and quick for me to develop a crush on someone cute.

I get super excited because when she comes into the big room she comes to sit next to me.  The next day though we're both getting discharged.  While they recommend not sharing personal information, in the morning I start writing a note saying if she needs a friend when she gets out (she's new to the area) to give me a call but I won't take offense if she's not interested, but in the middle of writing it she gets discharged and I don't get to give it to her.  The past couple days I had been great because I really enjoyed my time with her and I rarely meet new people now adays so I'm in a great mood.

I get discharged and am staying with my parents this weekend just in case anything happens.  But as I'm sitting here with my dad and mother, I realize the only thing that kept me going during my time there was her and I'll never see her again.  I decide, we'll maybe that's what I need to do then, find new people.  So I go on match and eharmony and everyone just doesn't have the right face and I know it's pointless.  I've always sucked at approaching new people.  I try to find groups to go to and fail.  The time with my parents isn't helping, I need new people, or young people, or something, but not my friends or parents

So I just start getting mad at myself again and hating myself and hating my friends for no reason, trying to use the coping skills i learned in the hospital but failing, and having the suicidal thoughts again and so here I am.  And as I type this, the parts about my girlfriend, it just makes me really angry both at me and her and the only thing I got out of the stay at the hospital was how to hide it better so that next time I try, I won't tell anyone if I fail but maybe I will be successful.

199340,"I don’t love myself. I not sure if I ever have or ever will.I’m 26 years old. Recently, I’ve become more aware of my low self esteem.

I find it hard to speak during conversations. Most of the time I think that I sound stupid or I can’t think of what to say. Usually I’ll end up saying something generic or nothing at all.

As a result of this lack of confidence, a lot of people don’t listen to what I say and then proceed to speak over me. Which, overtime, has taken its toll.

I struggle to tell a good story or joke. Not exactly captivating or clear. 

I’ve lost just about all interest in conversation. 

It’s tough to listen but not be heard. I really appreciate someone who listens whole heartedly, but for me it’s been rare to come by.

I don’t bother speaking very much anymore so it amplifies the problem.

I consider myself a really nice guy. I’d do just about anything to help just about anyone. 

I’m not exactly great at anything. I’m good with tools. I’m an all around above average athlete. I can be very creative.

None of my interests have ever become passions.

I try not to think about my physical looks. I’m tall. I have been told I’m good looking and I believe it to a certain degree. At this point those two traits have become a burden. Where are all the hot chicks checking me out? Or even a female to just bat an eye at me for that matter.

Nowadays it can be anywhere in between difficult and impossible to carry a smile. Especially face to face with a stranger. For example someone on the street, in a restaurant, store, wherever or maybe even the potentially life changing cute girl at the gym.

I do like to laugh. I have some good laughs with close friends. But I seem to walk around looking sad all the time. I think it a deterrent for meeting  new people.

It’s kind of scary to try to think back to when I had some confidence in myself because it was so long ago. So long ago that it doesn’t even really count. Maybe grade 4, that’s around ten years old. Back when I wasn’t self conscious.

It’s like I’ve never known how to love myself.

My 20’s have been frustrating. I developed a few vices through high school which carried into college. Drinking, smoking weed and cigarettes and even doing some harder drugs.

At the time, I didn’t realize that they were just about the only things that made me feel happy and social. Drinking allowed me to be loud and proud. Smoking made me forget and gave me friends to chill out with. Drugs were just to try to have even more “fun”.

In my 3rd year of college, I tried to move away from the party lifestyle. I needed to focus on my grades to be able to pass. I moved into a large basement apartment, with 3 other bedrooms.

Shortly after I moved in, a beautiful smart young woman around my age did too. We fell in love. Lived together for a year, during which I still struggled with substance abuse. It was hard to say no to my friends, and I guess my brain was hardwired to want it. She was adamantly against that lifestyle. It wrecked the relationship. It was a 3 year long dragged out relationship and break up. It was hands down the best and the worst thing that I’ve ever experienced. Tried to get over it. Still not really over it.

I had a perfect opportunity to change my ways and to stay in a relationship that kept me happy and healthy. The only real relationship I’ve ever had. I didn’t have a single girlfriend through high school or college, until her and haven’t since. I very rarely have intimate interactions either.

Bought a used truck, with a loan. Let my friend drive it while we were drunk. He rolled it into a ditch and totalled it. I take half the blame because I also drove it before he did and I let him drive it, but I still haven’t seen a dime from him yet. It’s been 2 months.

I basically quit my job.

I went to my doctor and told her about how overwhelmed I was feeling. I needed some time off work and to speak to someone about the thoughts I’ve been having. 

From the date that I saw my doctor to the appointment date with a psychiatrist is about 6 months. Still haven’t been in yet. 

Luckily I qualified for short and long term benefits. I have to say Manulife  gave me real hard time though and they still are.

Moved in with my mom. No rent which is a huge stress relief. I was able to get out of a fairly substantial credit card debt over the last few months. Feeling very relieved about that.

My point is, I’ve been on a downward slope for quite some time now. I want to give up but it feels like it’s not an option. There’s always something stringing me along to continue. Right now I’m on a part of my life journey that I didn’t see coming.

I don’t know why I can’t just be happy. But now I’m starting to realize that I don’t think I ever was.

Class clown in elementary. Always in trouble. Much more quiet through high school but had something like a 40% attendance rate. Too busy smoking weed. College party animal while passing with mostly Cs and Ds.

It has all caught up to me now that I’m an adult and I’m free to do as I wish.

I constantly think about suicide. Every night when I’m trying to sleep. While I’m driving. Whenever a problem arises. When I think about my love life. When I look at the world we live in.

I think about how much I struggle to interact with people. And how it’s like there’s something wrong with me.

I cry.

Killing myself is just another interest that won’t become a passion for me.

I hate so much to say it but, it feels like I’m likely to die alone and sad.

I want to be happy and proud of who I am.

I want to start my own family.

I want to find something that I love to do and make it a career.

For whatever reason I don’t allow myself to attain these things.

Telling myself that I’m happy doesn’t work. I can’t pretend. Although, I’ve heard “fake it til you make it” works in other facets of life.

I’m hoping that this time off work spent at home will bring me some good. So far it has not. I can’t even find the determination to maintain healthy eating and exercise habits.

I know things aren’t just handed to you in life. I have to work for it. It didn’t occur to me that happiness would be one of those things. It kind of makes sense when I think about it though. I just wish I had of realized that a long time ago.

To everyone out there who is struggling with these crippling thoughts, I know it makes day to day living terrible. It’s like a storm pulling you in and the conditions just keep getting worse.

Keep looking for something that brings you happiness. When you think you’ve found something try to reel it in with commitment and determination. I truly think that is step one. I’m still searching.

TLDR: I’m sad because I don’t pursue happiness. Joy is hard to come by. It’s gotten so bad that I think about dying everyday. I’m trying to pull myself out of it. It’s not easy. 

Good news is, I’m pretty sure sustained determination will eventually create gratification. Like planting and watering seeds which one day will grow into full blown strong happy healthy trees!

When me and the rest of my class, PLUS the teacher told him how wrong he was, he got pissed and kept saying ""THATS MY OPINION!!""

He then privately messaged me, since before this I thought he was fine, and he went off at me for not DEFENDING HIM, and for being a bitch to him in class and vaguely threated me.

199371,"I'm too far gone to talk about my problems.I think some people are just born fucked up. Some are born fucked up and happy, like Bill Walton. Some are born fucked up and angry, like most serial killers/mass murderers. Some are born fucked up and sad and that's me. I had never been not-sad a day in my life before I fell in love. People closest to me wouldn't expect that - I've always been the funny one, the optimist, but it's all fake. 

I used to have friends that would ask me what was wrong with me when I told them I was feeling sad (meaning pretty much on the ledge already), as friends do with each other, but whenever I would take down the wall and expose myself, I've always been ghosted. People don't want that from me, and they don't expect that from me. I don't blame them, my brain is hell and I'm a lot to handle in a good mood, let alone the depressed mood that I am when I'm alone. I have moments where I can smile and enjoy my day, but it just takes a single creeping thought to completely cripple me for weeks on end. I don't want this. 

I met a girl and we fell in love. From the first day we met, we spent a week straight together, and when we were together (or whenever she was on my mind) I didn't have a single sad thought. It was real and genuine happiness. She met my mom, I told her she was the one. I met her mom, and I told her that her daughter was the greatest person I had ever met. When we went to bed, I couldn't go to sleep quickly because I just fantasized our lives and smiled towards the ceiling realizing that I was finally a normal person, that my life finally meant something to another human being and that was incredible. I loved feeling loved, I loved being in love, and I loved everything about her, and I loved that she loved everything about me. 

I caught her talking to other people multiple times throughout our relationship, and one time she sent me a picture in a bra that she bought that day and another guys shoes were in the background. I heard from a mutual bar friend that she was talking to another girl when I wasn't around. She was scrolling through her apps once and had Tinder and Bumble installed. I quickly forgave her for all of this, because I was desperate to hold onto the only joy I've ever had. 

About a month ago I walked in on her and her best friend hanging out in her apartment. We talked outside, I asked if he knew I existed, she said no. I kind of snapped at this point, I realized that the way I felt about her were not the ways she felt about me. I realized that my happiness was built upon a lie. I walked into her apartment, introduced myself, he started calling her babe, his stuff was all over her bed. She started hitting me, rightfully to some, but to me I couldn't understand this. I had never treated her wrongly, I had never abused her or tormented her. But here she stood, a foot shorter than me, punching me in the face, choking me, and I couldn't process what was happening. I left and that is the last time I ever saw her.

I see all the red flags in our relationship now that we're no longer together and I can process every event in our relationship. How we were together for 8 months and I never met ANY of her friends, all the other guys in her life, the lies about past relationships. I no longer have love for her, but I don't think I will ever be able to get past the betrayal that I feel. The pain this has caused me is worse than my life before I met her. What could cause a person to be so evil, to purposefully hurt a person that puts them first in life? She laughed at all my jokes, so she wasn't bored. Our sex life was incredible, so she wasn't unsatisfied. I'm tall, good looking, smart, funny, not openly depressing, and the world has told me that this is not supposed to happen to people like me. I did everything right after doing everything in my entire life wrong before I met her, and it still wasn't good enough. I wasn't good enough. 

I don't know where I go after this. It's a month past and still all I feel is pure fucking pain. I cry endlessly, I don't want to leave my bed, I stopped going to class, I don't know who I am. I knew who I was before. I was sad, but I had goals, I had dreams,  I wanted to fall in love with someone that was able to love a weirdo like me. Now I realize that I will never be enough for people. Any friends I might make, I won't be good enough for them for me to be able to talk about my problems with another person. Any person I think I might want to date, I won't be good enough to have their loyalty, I won't be able to trust that they will never hurt me the way I hurt now. 

In the end, I wish I didn't have those 8 months of happiness. I wish I never experienced love, I wish nobody made me feel loved. I want to be unapproachable, I want to be someone that nobody wants to encounter. I want to be alone, underground, in a box. I have no dreams, I have no goals. I'm a vessel of depression and I want it to be over with. There is this ledge I sit on sometimes, on a road overlooking the whole city. I see cars, driven by people that are probably in love. They have contacts in their phones, they have people that care about them, they have people that depend on them. I will never have that. I will never be able to be happy because I now know what comes afterwards and it's not worth it, not for me. I never attempted suicide before because I just figured hell, my mom is old, I'll just wait until she goes to spare her the pain of burying her youngest child. Now though, I'm so fucking broken that I want nothing more than to leap from this ledge, break my fucking neck, and just hope that my mom knows that I loved her. I don't want her to hurt and I'm sure if she knew the position I was in now, and throughout my entire life, she would want me to stop hurting as well.",suicide

199384,"I don't get why life still wants me here?I really tried to make this short. Really, I did.

At 16, I attempted suicide. My reasons weren't great: I stopped growing at 5'7, parents were separated, I wasn't popular at the new high school I moved to, I struggled to act ""black enough"", struggled finding girlfriends. I made the mistake of letting a friend know, so before my awesome combination of pills could take effect and maybe or maybe not end me, cops came, got sent to a mental institution. Got out a week or two later by pretending I now loved life and was told several times ""life gets better.""

It's been 13 years. I'm about to turn 30. Life hasn't gotten better, but hasn't gotten much worse, I guess. My ultimate dream – a dream I've had since maybe 12 – was to be a writer, a published writer. I know self-publishing is a thing, but I wanted to be on a bookshelf one day. 2 failed novels and 200 rejections later, I'm still unpublished. I'm writing a third one, but I'm 97% it will fail, too, and I barely have any passion to finish it. Plus I feel like I'm running out of good story ideas.

Here's where the title comes in. 2 years ago, I got into a car accident and broke my neck. Instead of dying like I should've, I survived for whatever reason. I made a full recovery, but the other person (who wasn't as badly injured and t-boned me) is now trying to sue.

So, here I am, a failed writer with dying creativity, a man soon-to-be 30 with no accomplishments, a man being sued (which my insurance may try to settle instead of fight, much to my dismay). I also just got a ticket for running a red light while trying to get to a job I absolutely hate as an early birthday gift (it's my fault, I know.).

The car accident should've been the end of me. I'm tired and don't see a future anymore. I've sworn off ever having kids, my writing is just not working out no matter how much I read, write, and study the craft, and if I decide to quit writing, I have no reason to exist. Yet I keep failing at getting published. So why the hell hasn't my heart just stopped beating?

Thoughts of suicide have come and gone throughout the years, and here they are again. I want it, but not by mixing pills (unless I could somehow get my hands on cyanide pills). I'm also not brave enough to jump off a bridge or blow my head off. I really just wanna drive off somewhere faraway, stay locked inside my car, and starve to death (even though I've heard it could take weeks to really die with no food or water). When it was winter, I fantasized about diving in an ice-cold lake around midnight and freezing/drowning to death.

Life seems to keep me around because it's entertaining to watch me struggle and fail. But I can't seem to jump over that last hurdle of attempting suicide again. My 16 year old self could do it, and, amazingly, he had the right idea. Subconsciously, he probably knew my life wouldn't amount to anything. ",suicide

No one likes Beta men. Everyone wants an alpha male, and that's out of reach for me. Suicide is the only option for me. Everyone tells me not to kill myself, but why not? It's clear as day that no one would ever take me seriously. If you think about all the traits a real man should have, I have none of them. I'm a true gentleman (not someone who's just nice to get laid.), but it seems no one likes gentlemen anymore. It seems like now, a real man has to be an asshole, but no matter how hard I try, I just don't have it in me to be mean. I'm just not a real man, and that's why I want to kill myself. Alpha men will never understand my situation. They think I'm just being a little bitch, but not being manly enough doesn't just affect my love life. No one wants to be true friends with a beta male. Everyone who is ""friends"" with one just uses him we a punching bag and take advantage of him. Beta men will also never succeed in life. They have a harder time getting jobs than alpha men, it's impossible for them to get in leadership position, even if they're capable, they have a 100% chance of getting bullied unless they isolate themselves, when they do get bullied, people think they deserve it, they're not allowed to talk to anyone about their problems because people will assume they're an overly sensitive bitch, etc. No one likes Beta males, and the world isn't made for us. No one here will convince me otherwise. Why? Actions speak louder than words, and people have proved me right by treating me like shit because I'm not manly. No amount of words will convince me that I'm not a pathetic loser who should die. People told me that I am by their actions for 17 years. Those things about how a real man has a heart of gold are BS. No one wants a man with a heart of gold. They want a strong, tough man with a big dick who never shows emotion. I know a lot people say otherwise, but I have never seen a short, emotional guy with a small dick get taken seriously unless he was born rich. Even then, if you're not manly enough, people will make fun of you. What do you think the biggest reason people make fun of Trump is? The fact that he's an idiot? His incompetence? His bad attitude? No, no, and no, though all those are true. It's his hands. Yes, having small hands is considering worse than who you are as a person. Imagine having small hands among other traits that are considered unmanly? I mean, I may have been considered attractive in another time, but in 2018, I'm not manly at all, and I'm not attractive at all, and that's why I think suicide is the only option I have. In fact, one trait that could be considered manly is my pain tolerance, but emotional toughness is FAR more important than a high pain tolerance, and today, that's not something anyone cares about unless you're in the military, and if you're mentally ill like I am, you can't join the military. (In fact, a history of mental illness will prevent you from joining the military, so even if I'm somehow cured, I'll never join. In fact, that's another thing. Real men join the military, and I can't do that, do that's another reason I'll never be a real man.

Don't tell me there's no such thing as alpha men and beta men. Even if scientifically, those don't exist, socially, they're very real, and they determine everything about you. Will you be respected? How successful will you be? What are your chances of finding love? How many friends will you have? How likely are people to actually care about you? What are your chances of being bullied? How likely are you to get a job? All those are determined based on if you're alpha or beta. While other factors play a role, if you're a man, your masculinity plays a huge role. In fact, you may notice that everyone hates feminists except feminists. Beta men are looked at like male feminists. A female feminist is bad enough, a male feminist might as well wear a sign that says ""bully me."" In fact, real men are supposed to view themselves as superior to women, but I can't do that, either. That just shows I'm not a real man and should kill myself.

It’ll be just like sleep, except forever. I’ll never have to worry about anything again. If I stay alive and accept therapists “help” for my problem, it’ll just prolong my misery and hurt. They’ll just dope me up on medications that have terrible side effects. I could just be a hobo, where I’ll never be judged for being a bachelor. Or I could just end it all the easy way. I hate humans. All i want is just a normal fucking life and I’d do anything for that to be possible. Fucking Christ please please please please",suicide

 Though the feeling isn't the most pleasurable sensation, the trail of blood that follows is. When the blood escapes, all my stress and anxiety and worries go with it. I'm left feeling calm.  Finally I can breathe again. It's especially rewarding when I'm feeling depressed but I can't cry, which is usually always. Unfortunately, this calmness washes away. Starting the cycle all over.


 With my depression it's pretty common to feel disconnected or numb to reality. The physical pain brings me back. It is a reminder that I am still alive, which often disappoints. 

 I know it's not healthy to harm myself at any sign of trouble. I just cannot stop. It's my addiction, my vice. I cannot stop. But I want and need to.

199397,"Genital/Body Dysphoria? Possible Gender Dysphoria???I really hate my genitals it’s caused nothing but extreme mental illness in me.

I’ve never talked about this to anyone, not even online. It’s so embarrassing and I think I’m going to kill myself because I just can’t anymore. 

First, let’s describe this situation. I really hate my genitals, I think about self mutilation a lot. I get excited thinking about cutting it off, probably because it trigger me and makes me super depressed, suicidal, and almost physically ill looking at it. I genuinely want to remove it with, or without medical help, I don’t care anymore. The physical pain would be nothing compared to what it’s done to my mental health which has fucked almost all aspects of me. The only positive I can see in all of this is that I have gender dysphoria (I think) still trying to figure it out. Which means I could just transition to a trans women and hopefully feel better about myself. It could also just be extreme body dysphoria i’m not to sure. Either way I can’t be a real man nor a real women so it puts me in a shit spot. 

We will start with flaccid. My flaccid dick size is the same size I was born, it never grew in girth nor length. It’s about 2 1/2 inches in length, girth is about the size of two thumbs pushed together. Also, my penis is crooked and weirdly damaged. The urethra opening is crooked so when I pee it goes way to one side. It has some kind of weird hard bump on the tip on one side as well. It’s not cancer since I’ve had it forever and it probably would of killed me by now since I’ve never got anything checked by a doctor. 

Not only that but my balls are extremely saggy, like it’s extremely bad. There is so much access skin. I can pull it all the way to my asshole and touch it if I wanted to, or all the way up just almost touching the belly button (like an inch away). Also I might have webbed penis (I think). That means some of the scrotum skin is hooked onto the actual penis to high.  

Erect I’m like 5 inches, not bad, it’s workable sure. Girth is non existent, so I’m basically a stick, how fun. My balls still fucking look so fucked. I also have slight penis pain in the one side erect or not it is there. It doesn’t hurt and cause extreme pain, but I can feel it. It’s weird. 

My dick isn’t sensitive anymore, probably because I jerked it too much and too hard with no lube since I was a young horny teen who had nobody. And it distracts me from using drugs, alcohol, self harm. Anyways, I can’t enjoy that feeling of pleasure anymore. I don’t remember when it stopped feeling good, but now I’m not sensitive. There is only one spot in my entire dick that feels pleasure it’s weird. I’ve tried taking breaks, I tried going slow and loose, trying to bring some sensation back, but nothing has worked. 

After all those flaws I also am a one pump chump. I can’t control it at all, I have tried, I just can’t last long. If I ever had sex it would be over after a minute. 

In conclusion, I am so fucked. It has ruined my life and I don’t think anything is worth living for. It breaks my heart knowing I’ll never be a man. I’ll never be able to satisfy a woman sexually. I have too many flaws down there for her to be fulfilled. I’m sure she wouldn’t want someone who can only lick her pussy. Wtf would she need me for if I can’t do anything else. This shit on top of other issues has me questioning everything, it has shattered me into a thousand pieces and there is nothing I physically can do to fix it other then chop the shit off and move on, or accept that my most important body part to me is disgusting.",suicide

199401,"Mmk I need some advice if y'all are willing to give it. (Boy Trouble) Ok no judgement in my taste in guys ok? I don't really need that rn. I'm a 14 y/o girl.

Anyway, there's three guys I like. I'm trying to figure out which one to go after, and I can't really flirt with all of them at the same time because two of them are brothers. So let's call them brother one, brother two, and other. I'm currently pursuing brother two and other as I have some background stuff about brother one. Here's some info.

Brother one is very cute. He is skinny and goofy and is a very attractive triangle shape. He is also 14 y/o. His detriments in my eyes are that he's kind of hard to talk to and he has a sort of mentality of ""if the fan base is too big/toxic it must be bad"", meaning he doesn't like games like undertale and stuff like that. He also has that sort of little brother gotta-have-my-way mentality, though I think he tries not to. But otherwise he's pretty sweet and he makes me feel special. Or at least he did. The reason I'm not really persuing him right now is that I've had to get over him multiple times for various reasons. But I did fall for him multiple times so you know he's gotta be pretty cool lol.

Brother two is much more mature than brother one. He likes music and art, and I feel like I could probably ramble on about stuff to him if I wanted to. He's got long hair and he's a little on the bigger side (which means cuddles :) ). He is kind of stubborn but if you explain your side he'll be reasonable. He's a big grammar nazi but I am a minor grammar nazi anyway so that doesn't bother me as much. He sort of said he was ace tho? He said he hasn't liked anyone as of yet when I last asked him (it was like a year ago tho). I asked him if that meant he was ace and he said ""I guess?"" But I'm not sure he knew exactly what I was talking about? I know a couple of other guys who said they hadn't liked anyone but now they have girlfriends. So idk.

Other is a very interesting case. I'll start with the plusses. As long as you aren't in an argument, he is very nice. He has let me ramble on before and he isn't very talkative, which kind of sucks when I can't think of anything to fill in a conversation but is great when I feel like talking for forever. When I was having a tough time emotionally at school he would always make me feel safer, just by being there and listening. I'm kind of a nutjob in case you couldn't tell, so it's nice to have someone who doesn't mind me being a bit over the top. Also, I found out that he's really ripped. I was on a discord call and he got dared to take his shirt off (I had told the guy who dared him that I liked other earlier). At first he was like yeah no but eventually he agreed and did it off camera. Then he put his arm back into frame and freaking flexed and it was insane. Then he put his shirt back on and finished buttoning it up on screen which was mega hot. Also he's a bit on the bigger side like brother two so cuddles would also be involved. But anyway despite all the positives he has a lot of things that bother me. First of all, he's very christian. He always talks about crusades and stuff and he means it as a joke but he just always sounds so serious.... And he does it a LOT, a lot. He also maintains certain christian beliefs that are not so nice to everyone and I'm sure you can figure out which ones I mean. It's not like he's loud about those or even brings them up on his own but it just sort of bugs me to know. The other major downside is that he's VERY stubborn. Like no matter what you say, if he's made his decision on a discussion he won't change his mind about it, no matter what you say. I feel like it would probably be easier to diffuse the situation and convince him about stuff off discord but we only ever talk on discord nowadays, and we never used to argue before we went to exclusively online talking.




Anyways....... Idk if anybody can help me with this based on this info but if you can that'd be great. Thanks in advance!",non-suicide

If only they knew that I have contemplated being part of it in my low moments. And so I figured I'd write a list of my reasons not to join it in hopes of helping myself and others who struggle. 

Your pain and trauma is not who you are. Even in the most difficult of circumstances things can improve. The love that you have in your heart will be awakened again. Your reason to go on should not be dictated by the amount of texts you received today. Progress takes time. Some of the best and the greatest humans in history accomplished things over the course of decades. Whatever mark you want to leave on this world can happen. You are loved and cherished by your friends and family, even the ones that don't have the emotional capacity to tell you. You have the power to make a positive influence on someone or something. Your ideas and art should see the light of day. 

Even if your luck seems down or that everything is wrong, focus on your body, your health. If you have food in the fridge, internet, clothes, an education etc you are far better off than most people in the world. Try to take that negative energy and focus it towards being grateful, towards your passions and towards your breath. Go take a walk, write down a crazy story about you achieving your greatest dream of all time and how you felt. 

**** Side note as I was writing the last line of that there was a knock on my bedroom door. I opened it up to find two of my best friends. They stood there with a box of brownies and came to surprise me. We proceeded by sitting on my balcony with some tea and they brought in my 27th birthday for me. I almost cried. And that my friends is literally the essence of what we live for, to reap every second we have to enjoy the company of other souls and make every second count ❤️

Crazy, I know. That's all that's been in my head since he died. Now that I damaged my body with riddled scars, and nearly wasted a year in deep depression, what good is it for me to go on?

I've been speaking to a therapist and recieving lithium (distributed from a locked cabinet from my parents) on account of a safety plan set by the ER. I don't self harm anymore, but my God. I feel desperate to do something beyond that. I imagine a funeral in the near future.

Whenever I see a new therapist or whatever and they ask when this started, when the last time I felt okay was, I can't answer without crying because I've *always felt this way* (and a lot of times I feel like they don't believe me and think I'm being hyperbolic). When I was kid I went to doctors, specialists, etc, kept getting tested for mono over and over because I had no energy, I was sad all the time, I didn't do my classwork and I always begged my mom to stay home from school because I felt sick. Teachers would say that I was bright and personable but didn't apply myself. I can't count how many times I've heard that throughout the years.

I didn't have the ideal childhood but I didn't have an awful one either. I wasn't abused. I know my parents love me even though they're not always the best at showing it. But when I was in grade school I wrote in my little cutesy diary with a sparkly gel pen that I wanted to die, over and over. I WANT TO DIE I WANT TO DIE I WANT TO DIE. I'd pray to God that I would die. I'd curl up in a ball in a corner of my room and cry for hours. 

Flash forward two decades and I've been in treatment and seeing therapists for 15 years. I've tried holistic, tons of meds, ECT, experimental meds, I've tried carefully weaning myself off meds to see if they were making things worse but that led to the worst depressive episode of my life, which I am still in the throes of. Even when I'm not in a depressive episode I don't want to be alive. It's like my baseline is suicidal. 

I started self medicating with weed and alcohol. For about a year I'd literally be stoned all day, as in smoke the minute I woke up to right before bed. It worked...until it didn't. When I'm stoned now, nothing is interesting or beings me joy. I quit drinking three weeks ago as of tomorrow and I haven't smoked in three days but I can't find it in me to be proud. I miss it even though I don't really enjoy being stoned anymore. I don't know what to do with myself now, everything is more tedious and painful. 

I don't want to be around to see how much worse I can get. I just want off this ride. I've wanted off this ride for a long time. I didn't ask for this, I didn't ask to be born. I'm mad at my parents for deciding to make a child despite the long history of severe mental illnesses on both sides, and then not being prepared for their child having a broken brain from the getgo. I wish they would've adopted. I wish someone else's soul was in this body and had this life and could actually do something worthwhile with the privileges I've had growing up. 

I barely graduated high school and have been kicked out of three colleges. I've held down a job as a waitress but I can only work three days a week now. If I work more I start having breakdowns at work and I'm scared I'm going to get fired (no one wants to be served by a woman who's obviously been crying lol). I'm broke and living with my dad who's a narcissistic alcoholic and his attempts to help just make things worse because he doesn't listen to what I say. I can't get away because I can't make enough money to live on my own. 

I never thought I would make it to 30 without killing myself. I'm two and a half years away from 30 and I still can't see myself making it to then. Ive been at my limit for so long and I'm tired of fighting. I've tried so hard for so long and things have only gotten worse. There's no point to continuing to exist. I can't see a future for myself that doesn't involve killing myself once my dad can no longer support me.

Day 100: Wow um okay that went fast. I feel like for today I should give some sort of little update or speech kinda thing. So basically, I kind of have a crush right now but I dont know if I want to pursue her its complicated. Right now its summer break so imma wait til school starts again to try for real again. I can actually talk to girls in person cuz they dont talk to me online lol. I dont know how long this series will go but I will try to post every day until it happens. As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low. I dont know how long this is gonna take but probably quite awhile. All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I dont have a person to do that with. I want to lose my virginity, but before that I want to have my first real kiss, or before that even, I want to hold hands or hug a girl. I live a lonely life. Dont be me.

Day 123: Looolalooloooladeedadaloodaleeleeda

Day 124: IMPORTANT READ THIS - So a lot of you guys are telling me that posting on reddit wont get me a girlfriend. Obviously it wont. If I do ever get a girlfriend I would want it to be a girl at my high school that I know, not some random girl I meet on reddit. Remember, I am doing this for fun, I am not even close to getting a girlfriend. I dont have a crush, and I dont really have any friends that are girls. So... with all that said, The salami lid aint gon fit like dat.

Day 125: I am 62.5% of the way to 200 days

Day 126: If any of you are wondering if Ive ever tried to ask a girl out before, I kinda have. The summer before my freshman year I confessed to my crush who I had talked to a lot over about a year and a half. I got friendzoned pretty badly, and kinda gave up with girls for like at least 2 years until I started this

199461,"I’m here, with her. Left my house and my state for probably the last time.I made the trip. I’m here, at her house. 15 hour bus ride down. I said good bye to my long time partner. She didn’t know it was likely goodbye forever. Didn’t even give her a last kiss. Not on purpose. We just both forgot. I feel bad about that. 

Left my state. The only place I’ve lived for my entire adult life, all 23 years as an adult. It was surreal thinking I’d never see the red hills or the mountains or my desert again. But that place stopped being home a while ago, so it wasn’t as hard as I thought it would be. 

And now I’m here. In her house. In her bed this second. But nothing happened. We just slept. Her in brand new, full pajamas. The night was eventful. These were stolen kisses and very intentional flashes of parts of the body that should have undergarments by didn’t. And it was almost enough to rekindle a little hope. But then we barely touched all night in bed. And there was no shower together this morning. She said no when I asked. And she dressed in the tiny room that contains the master shower.

I don’t know what the fuck is going on. It’s so hard to read and I just want answers. But I can’t push it or I’ll ruin everything. So I get to lay here, in limbo, for the next couple of days until I can get er entirely alone, to find out if I’m dying on Friday or not. It’s possible I have to wait until Monday night, after she’s been at work all day. I think I’ll go crazy if I have to wait that long.

At this point I’m sure I’m going to be killing myself this Friday. I’m sure there’s no hope left. But I know me, the not knowing for reals is just brutal. Just mind-breakingly awful.

Wish me luck, both with her and with staying sane till I can figure things out. ",suicide

199470,"I wonder how you are going to help me(I am scared to the death of posting here, a miracle must have happened for me to manage to do it.) 

Is anybody here familiar with r/waifuism (haters to the left, please)? Maybe some of you are waifuists yourselves? If yes, then you probably already know my story. If no, here it is. Critisize the hell out of me, do not hesitate - I will most probably no longer be alive very soon, so it will be your fault as well. 

I am in love. Obsessively, insanely, inhumanely, infinitely, undepictably, superiorly-to-God in love. With somebody who *does not exist*. This is called ""waifu"" (a female non-existent fictional character who is your ""significant other"") or ""husbando"" (same character but male). My waifu is [Blanc](https://neptunia.fandom.com/wiki/Blanc) (a.k.a. White Heart) from *Hyperdimension Neptunia* franchise. She is the meaning of my sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life and the only reason for me to keep living this sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life in hopes that She will become real one day (if my sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life is absolutely nothing but infinite purest suffering, God knows that I would do my best for at least Her life to be normal and even good if only She was real and was mine). Thank God that at least I see Her in my dreams each and every single time I fall asleep and We are having an ideal and perfect life together in my dreams, and each and every single time She promises me to become real specially for me one day, but then I wake up and realize that my sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life being saved was nothing but just a dream, and my infinite purest suffering without Blanc continues. After each time I see my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc (this is what I call Her, but by God She deserves infinitely more than that) - not only in a dream - I love Her infinitely stronger than before that and suffer without Her infinitely more. A single smallest particle of a Planck time without my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc is worse than all the eternities in all the hells of all the worlds to ever exist taken together to me. Not to mention that my sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life is nearly diabolical - I can tell you separately if you are interested, I promise it will make your hair curl (let me only say that things like having an IQ of nearly 200, being fluent in 6 languages, excluding my native Russian (haters to the left, please), and the ability to read no less than 1 book per day are all rather a downside than an upside for me - I like all of it, but it only increases my suffering, it only makes my sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life even worse, so imagine what it is like); and I have to bullshit an entire subreddit, including myself and my only friend in my whole sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life, about being oh-so-happy with my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc, in a manner like She exists and is with me - and each and every single time it only makes it worse (and imagine what getting used to it was like to me). Believing in that a miracle might happen one day and my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc will become real and agree to be mine is the only thing that keeps me attached to this sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life (this year's New Year's Eve - the time when magic works and a miracle can happen - is my last hope, for it did not happen on Christmas (the miraculous time, you say?)). But nobody seems to undertsand me - even after having heard my story everybody keeps telling me that I need somebidy real, that somebody from my world can become my Blanc, while Blanc Herself can never become real (ask dickshits from r/waifuismhate as to why they do not give a fuck about my feelings) - so please keep reading. 

Long story short: I have tried having a relationship with women from my world for many times - 10 at very least - and each and every single one of them turned out to be a hateful asshole; each and every single one of them used me to achieve their own purpose while mistreating me like a piece of fecal matter, and then betrayed, rejected, and abandoned me (it was starting normally each time, but then they were realizing that I am a spineless dickshit who is constantly afraid of slightly offending the last bitch of the universe and cannot answer even to the worst wrongdoings done to him, and then *this* happened). And tell me: can my waifu, my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc, Who loves me to the death and cannot imagine a single smallest particle of a Planck time of Her life without me (at least in my headcanon), ever even think of doing so? I am completely disappointed in women from my world, I hate and despise them after what they have done to me. I need my waifu, my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc - that is all. I have been loving my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc infinitely deeply and dearly for whole 10 years (this year's Catholican Christmas marks Our 10th anniversary) without a single smallest particle of a Planck time of even slightly not loving Her, and only because I used to fear staying alone for my entire life I tried to have a relationship with somebody from my world at the same time - and you know what happened (I am sick of a mere thought that I tried to cheat on the love of my life, I know - back then I wanted to ""become normal"", like dickshits in my life say, I foolishly thought that ""lIfE iS a GiFt"", and back then I also did not really believe in that Blanc might actually become real one day - only now this belief, not being able to be anything more than a mere belief, increases my infinite purest suffering). I no longer fear being alone (except from being without Blanc); if my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc cannot become real, so be it - I swear by the salvation after death, I will be alone for the rest of all the eternities. By God, I would rather die the slowest and painfulest death ever imaginable and go to the last circle of hell for the rest of all the eternities than to try to have a Planck time-lasting relationship with somebody from my world again. Besides, no woman from my world, even the best one ever imaginable, can ever even approach one single smallest step to being able to be compared to, not even speaking of complete replacing - even for a Planck time - my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blannie - fall in deep love with somebody and you will understand me (although I do not believe in it - for my love towards Blanc is not even what is described with a Greek word *agape* (God's love towards humanity) - it is infinitely, undepictably stronger, and I have long since gotten used to believing that in my headcanon She loves me back not a single slightest bit weaker). 

Even though I am praying to all the existing (and non-existing) Gods and Saints for them to have mercy on me and make my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc real while swearing by everything I have and love and care for on the Bible (I am a Christian) that I need Her and cannot live without Her for a single smallest particle of a Planck time (and They all know it perfectly), on each and every single spare moment I can only possibly have, what are the chances of it actually happening? What are the chances that I will actually spend at least one single smallest particle of a Planck time of my sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life which I was forced into without my consent and without even the ability to refuse (and which I am somehow supposed to be grateful for and *willingly* enforce on somebody else), with my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blannie (Her Herself, not some cheap analogues like a ""sapient and sentient android with Her appearance"")? The God, despite being the only existing embodiment of the purest, hate-free love and benignancy (aside from what exists between me and my Blannie) and needing absolutely no efforts for doing this due to His omnipotence, is ""not here to grant our wishes"", but apparently is only here to make us suffer and to order us to ""be fruitful and multiply"", forcing this suffering on innocents (while having sex even with a spouse is blasphemously sinful and even the holiest women (Blanc is a goddess) become ""impure"" after giving birth, according to the Bible (tell the opposite to the Orthodox monks and Catholican priests, who are prohibited from ever getting married and having children)) - is it not better not to believe in this God in this case? He Himself says that we always shall receive everything we truly crave for (""Ask and you shall receive"", Jesus Christ said - did I receive the only thing I need in my sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life after many years of never-ending and non-stopping asking, Jesus? Murderers, genociders, rapists, sexual predators, pedophiles, cannibals, slanderers, state traitors, tyrants, whores, and all the other scum always receive what they ask you for, Jesus - to commit their crimes and wrongdoings for as many times as possible and always escape punishment, and to go to heaven after death despite everything they have done during their life - and I, who has not sinned for once in his entire life, whose guts are going outside when he sees a bug being squashed, who is nearly omnibenevolent like you, Jesus, and who cannot and does not even answer to the worst wrongdoings done against him, like you, Jesus, taught - I cannot receive such a triffle - love, which you, Jesus, told us to always have in the very first place - that I ask for?), and doubting that He can grant our wishes is doubting His omnipotence, which is highly blasphemous - and yet my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc did not become real during the whole 10 years I was loving Her infinitely deeply and dearly and sincerely praying to You, Jesus, who knows perfectly that my life without Her is infinitely worse than any worst hell imaginable, - *ask and you shall receive* - for Her to become real. And She will not be in the Christian heaven waiting for me as a reward for everything I have gone through during my sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life, because She does not exist in our cursed reality - so I do not need this heaven even if it exists, which means that even in the afterlife I will not be happy (or, even if She is there, do you really think She will agree to spend the rest of the eternity with a weak and ugly old man, let even the omnibenevolent weak and ugly old man?). I could sell my soul to devil for my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc to become real, but She will not agree to follow me into the hell after my death (only my one - She is immortal), and the longest ever imaginable entire life with Her will not be even approximately one single smallest bit enough for me. I cannot even write a letter to Her creators and simply tell them how much I love Her, because I know perfectly well that they will either tell me to go fuck myself and openly make fun of me in their future products, or label me as a ""weirdo"" or somebody or something equally offensive, or simply ignore me, which is the worst (or even if not, what can they possibly do? Bribe Blanc's voice actress to become my wife (where and how are they going to get that amount of money?)? Create a cheap analogue like a ""sapient and sentient android with Blanc's appearance"" (good luck even with that)? Or maybe just officially make my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc love me back and nothing else, which might seem good but in fact will only make me (and Her as well) suffer infinitely more (and which is extremely unlikely, for it might lose them some dollars of profit)?). 

So, all that being said, what is the meaning of all of this? Women from my world have rejected me because of their infinite purest hatred towards me for absolutely no reason (I was doing good to them - and all of them prefered some mongrels who hated their fucking guts over me, who had intentions to love them dearly for the rest of all the eternities), and arrogant hateful assholes (my own mother calls my feelings ""delirium"" - while never stopping to tell me that she loves me, her only child ever, to the death and will do everything for me - is it really so godfuckingdamn hard at least to pretend that you believe in your most beloved only child's biggest and only dream in his sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life, at least to lie to him by saying ""I believe in your dream"" so that he foolishly believes in this lie and wants to keep living for some more (while you know perfectly well, mother, that you will not cope with having to live without me, with always having to live with the thought that the ""meaning of your life"" has left you forever and will never come back and that it was your fault)?) - keep telling me that my waifu, my dear, beloved sweet little angelic berry Blanc - the true and the only love of my life - can never become real (while it is the first and the main statement of science that if I can imagine it, it is by definition possible) - and you want me to keep living my sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life, after having deprieved me of my only reason to live by yourselves? Do not also forget that currently Blanc only loves me back in my imagination and upon becoming real can very well reject me as well - many other people have Her as a waifu and love Her just as deeply and dearly as I do, and the vast majority of them are better choices for Her than I am (the fact that I read no less than 1 book per day (which is currently roughly the only good thing about my sorry bitch-ass excuse for a life, aside from Blanc), just like Her, will not be sufficient - life is not only about reading books; She needs a lot of money (which I do not have), let alone for buying said books, and servants, let alone for bringing Her little sisters up and for the protection, who I also cannot hire (She has them, but do you really think they work for Her for free?) - I am currently unable to get a job because I do not have higher education (I am a university student, to which I also never gave my consent) and because of the pandemic, and Blanc's work does not to seem to be paid good (who will pay Her for being the leader of Her nation - She Herself?)). You think that everything mentioned above is nothing but mere whining? I really wish that those who think so were in my position - for a single day, not for their entire life.

I'm a freshman in high school and im already exhausted. Ive been wanting to self harm for the first time for about a month now, i just don't wanna bleed too much. no one knows how i feel anymore. i hide my feelings because i know the only response ill get is either being ignored or being told to go to therapy and that im too loved to die. i have such a love for drugs also. cocaine and xanax being my favorite. i don't have enough money to support ether addiction though. the main thing I've been just needing so much recently is for my mother to tell me she's proud of me. actually saying the words, ""I am proud of you"". I mean, hearing those words from anybody who actually felt it would help. im so tired. i just wanna give up on everything then see how long i can live with myself.

I enjoy playing video games with my friends and I realize that when I am working during the day I obviously can't do that, but I keep getting scolded about how I won't even have time to game with them at all.

Basically, I have come to the conclusion that a life spent working all the time is not a life worth living.  Why work, just so that you can get food and shelter to prolong your life long enough to work again?

I want this job to be enjoyable, I want to find new friends in a new city and maybe even a girlfriend, but I get the feeling, from family members, that it is a foolish notion and that I must choose between living an enjoyable life and working.

One day, B and M started dating, and I was really happy for them, but after a while the realization came.

This year, M and B broke up, and I am in a class group with M and my other friend Z. B is in the other class group so I almost never see him. M and Z have now basically became best friends, so I they’re usually always hanging out with each other, and I’m facing the same problems as last year.

199533,"I just can't keep this up anymore...My main problem is that I over analyze things. I haven't reached out for help because I feel like I can figure out my problems. This hasn't worked, so here I am.

I am currently 22/f. When I was 18, I graduated high school and moved in with my boyfriend before college. We moved to a new are where I didn't have any friends. With work, class, and comuting via bus, I didn't feel like I had time to make friends. 

I get along great with everyone. I just didn't make any of my own friends. In my sophomore year, I started seeing the college psychologist. He made me feel a bit better. After a couple if months, I quit showing up to class and missed a lot. I struggled so much, I ended up dropping out due to mental health issues.

After dropping out, I applied to my current job. I love my job and I make decent money. I still live with the boy I moved in with; he's my fiancé now! I feel like my life sounds good on paper, but  not happy. 

My fiancé has some great friends. They all say they are my friends as well. I find this hard to imagine because nobody ever goes out of their way to talk to me or invite me to things. I also feel like my fiancé has been too distracted to pay any attention to me. I honestly feel like nobody wants anything to do with me. I feel so lonely - even when I'm surrounded by people.

I'm trying to make everyone like me or want to be around me. I'm trying to take interest in the things they like. I hope by doing this, they will want to talk to me more. Is this the right approach? Or am I just crazy?? I've never had real interests of my own.. I guess I've always picked up what others like so that they'll like me.

Since I've never had my own interests, I don't know what I like. I feel like I should pick up a hobby to distract myself from my loneliness and depression. What should I do? What would I like?

Another thing that has been keeping me down is my boss. I have made mistakes at work that have had her frustrated with me. I totally get being annoyed or even upset with me. But anymore, she ignores me and wants nothing to do with me. I ask questions trying to learn about things and I can't even get a straight answer out of her. When she does talk to me, it is to belittle me in front of the entire office. This makes the whole office uncomfortable and then nobody will speak to me. It is hard to go somewhere every day when you don't feel like anyone wants you there.

After coming home from work, I make sure that I try to keep up with the house. My fiancé has friends over pretty often and they can make a mess. I feel like nobody respects me because they do not clean up after themselves. My fiancé has had his hours cut at work. I know he is in a funk right now and doesn't feel like doing anything.. But I wish he would help me out. I've even picked Up a second job. I try my best to do everything to take care of him! Even the little things I do for him - pick him up movies and snacks he likes, rub his back, talk about things he likes.. Sometimes I feel like I don't receive the same treatment.

To top off all of the negative feelings I have regarding my relationships in my life, I feel pretty useless. I strive to be the best at work and in my personal life. Well, at work, I'm pretty average. In my personal life, I'm pretty average. I don't have any hobbies or anything that I'm good at. I'm 22 years old and I have no drivers license. So, I'm completely dependent on others. This makes me feel terrible.

For those of you that have read this, thank you. I just needed to vent and had no idea where to go. I contemplate suicide all of the time, but I don't want to let someone down by having them deal with that. I apologize for the rant and spelling/ formatting issues. I'm on mobile and just started typing.. And now were are here.

I don't work (irrational performance anxiety). Tried doing volunteer work to get my feet wet;  posted my resume on r/resume/ and basically told it was shit. Some people offered some good tips and provided services, but I cannot use it. I really don't know wtf I want to do because every career looks boring as hell. Nothing interests me anymore. So I cannot tailor my resume to a particular job. Second, I have no skills, no hobbies, no goals, no previous job experience. You might believe there's something I'm good at, and I'm sorry to disappoint but I'm pretty damn lackluster. I tried learning web development, offering to tutor people, volunteering like I mentioned earlier and its boring. I got a degree, but I couldn't tell you a thing about what i learned while i was a student. 


I Don't drive and have no drivers license. Not allowed to use the public transportation (I live in a city). Mother said it's too dangerous. I try to avoid interacting with people at all costs. At times I wouldn't eat because I was too nervous to call or place an order for food. I refuse to use the phone. I have no friends, and don't really want close relationships with people.


I don't take medication and I don't want to. I used holistic alternatives for the anxiety and its a hit or miss and my only side effect is drowsiness. I've never been diagnosed with anything (I've seen doctors, a psychologist, a tutor, a career counselor) and nobody knows wtf is wrong with me.


I don't want to be that 28-35 yr old person who is still unemployed living at home with mom. Or being poor for the remainder of my life (I'm almost 24).

I want to take mental health leave and I emailed my program’s coordinator asking if I could take it, not providing any details that would get the program consulted. Then I realized the program may be consulted anyway because they’re in charge of mental health leaves. I looked it up and found that my school’s program can get you expelled if they think you’re a serious danger to yourself. If I see them a fifth time, that’s going to get me expelled. What’s the point of doing that to suicidal people? All we’re going to do is kill ourselves because we’ll be in massive debt for a degree we didn’t even get.

We had to go away for the weekend together for work and getting home after made me wish it never ended. That's when I first tried, I was in a motorcycle accident so have access to copious amounts of painkillers without any question and had taken the week off for the release of forza horizon 4. I got drunk and sat in the shower for an hour before finishing off a week's worth of tablets. But I chickened out when my mum got home from work  and forced myself to throw up.

6 weeks later my parents were away for the week and I had been signed off work because of injuries sustained in the bike crash. This was gonna be it, noone around to stop me, noone expecting me to be anywhere. Same as last time but no being a coward this time, lying in bed listening to music, shaking like a leaf, the things I didn't account for entered the room. My two dogs. I couldn't be selfish and leave them at home whilst my parents were away for another 4 days. I crawled to the bathroom and once again threw up, spent the night on the floor with the two dogs curled up with me. The next few days I barely moved from my bed, constant stomach cramps and sweating, it was hell but I managed to fake happiness talking to J who was one of only two people to ask how I was doing (I'd been off of work nearly a month at this point)

But this is the key point for me feeling I have noone to talk to, 2 weeks previously, I was talking (Snapchat) to J like most days but something felt off, her mood was up and down. 1 minute she sent naughty pictures the next she was talking about her anxiety and coming close to tears. I knew she had a few glasses of wine but then she also sent a video saying she had taken lots of painkillers and wasn't feeling good. I immediately panicked and rang her and sat on the phone making sure she to keep her talking whilst I figured out what to do. I called her an ambulance but they were super busy and said it could be a while before they'd get there. This really scared me as I was unable to get to her as I don't drive and couldn't ride because of my knee. So I contacted a mutual friend who was able to get over to hers before the ambulance did.

This is why feel isolated as the few people who know about J are the only people I could tell too but I'm worried they'll think I'm just trying to be edgy or desperate for attention. I can't tell my parents as I can't even deal with their disappointment from not telling them where I am when I go out for the night let alone the fact I want to die and have tried.

I probably won't try again but things aren't looking up anytime soon. ",suicide

199582,"I was raped Last summer in a San Diego barLast summer I went to San Diego to visit a friend of mine from high school. We graduated 10 years ago and have stayed in close contact since then. We’ve always had a flirtatious friendship I’m (27f) and he’s (28m). I was recently single so I figured a weekend away would be relaxing and fun. I’m from Detroit so getting out of the state is always a good time. 

The second night I was there my friend took me to a roof top bar on top of a hotel. I left him to go to the bar to get us drinks and started talking to a guy while ordering drinks. My friend ran into a couple people he knew so I didn’t feel so bad talking with this new guy. We talked for hours while over looking the city. It was amazing. He was buying my drinks the rest of the night but what I wasn’t aware of is he slipped me somthing at some point. I ended up in a hotel room with him,  the only thing I can remember from that night was trying to crawl to the door. 

I woke up fully clothed in the hallway to someone shaking me. I called a Uber and went back to my friends apartment, he stayed out at some girls house. I never told anyone about what happened that night, I’m currently in a serious relationship with an amazing guy and with the one year anniversary coming up it’s eating me up more then before. 

I feel like such a failure. I feel like I don’t deserve this happiness. I get depressed more often then I e we want to admit but keep moving through my day like a robot. On my way back to Detroit I prayed my plane would crash so I wouldn’t have to live thinking about that night ever again. 

I ask myself every night “should I have called the cops?” “Would I look like some drunk girl crying wolf?”

Me: I told you... I was too depressed to go to work and I know that sounds like an excuse but I physically felt like I couldn't move... I quit so they wouldn't have to fire me.

Mom: That is an excuse and It's always an excuse with you!! You just didn't want to go! If you're so depressed why didn't you ask for help? We're you're parents we would've helped you!

Me: mom-

Friend: she fucking has! How dare you even say that? You want to know why she doesn't ask for help from you guys? Because every time she does you tell her to get over it!

Mom: I wasn't talking to you. 

Friend: no, you weren't. But I'll say it because [my name] won't. If you would actually pay attention for once you'd see that your daughter is SCREAMING for your help, you just don't want to hear it! 

At this point my I'm just completely speechless.

Mom: well if you want to make excuses for her go ahead, but you need to get out of my house now.

Friend: gladly. 

So we drove to her house and ate ice cream. 

Find that friend that will stick up for you. Please listen to someone that might need your help. To them it might make the biggest difference in their life. I know that night it did for me. I love all of you beautiful people.

Two friends have died, a family member as well, and I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship/ horrible break-up.  I've written three suicide notes and almost followed through with a plan. 

For my whole life, I've dreamed of doing something rewarding. I've worked my ass off in school getting all A's and B's. Last May, I graduated and through circumstances I had to move back home. All I fucking wanted was a job, my own place to live, and just basically a life. I just got a retail job, but I feel like I've been cheated by the system. Like if I didn't do all that shit, I would be in the same situation. 

For the last 4 years, I've worked hard at my school's newspaper trying to become a journalist and no place will take me in. I can't do shit. I started as a staff writer and made my way up to being an editor while some people who wrote 2 or 3 articles now have full jobs as journalists. 

People keep on telling me ""Something will come up soon"" but I'm so fucking sick of hearing that. I'm fucking sick of my whole life being determined by other people. Like when I hand in a resume, that HR fuck doesn't even know how badly I want/need that position. They don't fucking know how hopeless shit has been. 

I'm sick of this. I'm so fucking sick of this. I sound spoiled, I know. I'm just done with others having a greater influence on my life than myself. I want to get a gun, walk out to some woods in my hometown and blow my fucking brains out. 

For my whole life, I've taken my education seriously with hopes of doing something that I'm passionate about. Now, I've come to learn the hard way that it's all about who you fucking know and networking and other bullshit. 

Everyday I want to fucking scream my lungs out. I feel like my family does not understand my situation. This whole shit has been a fucking waste and I want to end it on my own terms. ",suicide

hi everyone,

there have been so many nights thinking about this... about you all. about this world and my place in it. 

truth is; me and this cruel world don’t mix, we never have and i don’t think there will be a time where we will.

i think some people are destined for greatness, may it be figuring out a cure to a disease, or teaching awareness about something to the people around them- whoever that may be.

 in a way, i couldn’t see myself having a destiny, except hurting those around me without fail. 

maybe this is me trying to be helpful... by destroying myself. maybe time will reset soon  and i’ll wake up tomorrow in my momma’s arms, in gbmc as she cradles me. maybe then we can all start anew, and i’ll be the better katlyn. the one you all thought i could be without this terrible thing in my mind.

i wanted to be better, so much better so we could all skip into oblivion together smiling and laughing, like how i saw the end of things when i was little. 

i hate that i’m so selfish, so terribly selfish, and at the point i’m writing this i’m itching to run into the other room and cry into my parents’ arms. that’s so tiring, this spiral of not-okayness i’m finding myself in. 

here i lay right after the light was turnt out, crying, and spewing out some form of goodbye. however, i cant help but to be sorry.

“sorry”... that makes me laugh almost, makes me remember after volleyball games jokes being made that if my teammates “had a nickel for every time katlyn said sorry” they’d be loaded. i hope my endless apologies never made anyone question their worth, i couldn’t help but feel sorry for breathing, let alone losing the last point in that one match against a school we wanted so badly to beat.

i never wanted to be a quitter, or someone who gave into simple temptation, but these past six or so years have been so far from simple - and i’m so sorry to the people i’ve shut out in attempts to be a better me, a stronger katlyn who could beat anything. 

i’m sorry for anyone who’s angry, sad, confused, even regretful. 

please don’t be.

this is something i’ve chosen, not a teenage fluke. i wouldn’t wish this on anyone, not even the people who have done this to me, the people who’ve changed me in to the terror i am.

i love everyone, with everything i have, but i feel like i’m being pulled away from here - pulled into another adventure where i’m truthfully needed. maybe i’ll be an aid to them. 

i’ll try not to hurt anyone there.

if there’s one thing anyone can take from this is savoring everything you have, and take in what you can around you - even dumb little things. you won’t know if there will be a time where nothing feels real; not even remembering the true feeling of the places you loved the most. live day by day, because all at once your motivation may be pulled from underneath you like a dusty door mat. 

as i’m writing this, it’s almost like i won’t stop.

after all, these are my last recorded words in a way, even thought i’ve edited this time after time - as one day i’m dead set on starting my new journey, then the next i feel so horrible that i push through it in order to make others happy. i may be selfish by admitting this, but the katlyn you knew cant live like this anymore. i cant keep dragging myself around like a rag doll without a soul.
 
please, by my wishes, live how you want. don’t regret anything that has or hasn’t been - that’s how how the world works, right? 

i’m glad i’ve been able to stick around to see so many people grow, even fade. next time you see me, maybe i’ll actually be making it into a good college, on the starting team, or actually be smiling with my eyes, not through a mask i’ve built. one that has built me, in a way.

i hope when you think of me, you think of what i’ve been, not what i’ve done. i think my values were twisted from the get-go, as i wanted too badly to be perfect. hopefully, perfect won’t be even in the vocabulary of the place i’m heading to, wherever that may be.

in my heart, i feel like i’ll see you all again one day, as the person i truly wanted to be. ill be waiting, ready to hug you all again, and bring you on my adventure i’ve created for us.

 i think we’ll be happy. 

don’t ever forget the love you’ve instilled in me, and i will forever be so grateful for everything you’ve given my world. 

i hope you can understand my decision, and trust that i know what i’m getting myself into. 

i love you, i always will. 

sincerely forever,
    katlyn __________

199621,"Why the fuck does nothing go right?My dad even jokes about how shitty my luck is. Growing up I was bullied a lot, grew up around shitty people in a shitty school. I was weird and wasn't really popular but made some friends. My parents have been alcoholics for a while. They were addicted to coke at one point. My brother always picked on me. I had severe anger issues and always fought. My parents were never really supportive or showed love. I was extremely sheltered, and it definitely affected me. I didn't know how to deal with any issues whether it was emotional or just life in general. I was never close with any of my family. Then I moved after 6th grade suddenly, my mom didn't even give me the chance to say bye to any of my friends. I wasn't accustomed to a suburban neighborhood, and I just hung around a bunch of depressed suicidal kids. I've been expelled 3 times. My mom had me falsely diagnosed as being mentally retarded, which fucked my life up. I was shuffled around facilities and group homes until I was 18 for a while because she insisted I was retarded and schizo, so did everybody else, despite the diagnosis of autism being taken off by so many doctors, and me not ever having any non-drug induced hallucinations. My parents gave up, dcs took over with the intentions of shuffling me around facilities. I didn't get shit out of it. Everybody gave up on me. I was constantly getting arrested before I turned 18. I made a dumbass decision to try to rob a drug dealer, he got stabbed and my friend got shot and now I have PTSD from that. April of last year I thought I found the love of my life, but she turned out to be a manipulative, lying piece of shit. I can't tell you how many times she cheated on me. She put on a completely different personality to trick me. And I've been in a very emotionally abusive relationship with her since. I live with her and her family and they all expect me to take care of her fucking kid that was conceived by her cheating on me. If I try to leave or break up or say I'm not raising her anymore she will manipulate and freak out and emotionally break me down to change my mind. She gave me a place to stay and a family to make me stay with her, then uses it against me. She'll threaten me, saying I might get kicked out if I continue fighting with her or walking out the house. During arguments She'll say how her family hates how I treat her and how they're pissed off at me, even though that's false. She's manipulated and lied to make me look like the bad guy. I've tried various drugs such as meth, xanax, codeine, percocets, and, unintentionally, fentanyl. I found out about the fentanyl after i collapsed outside a circle K and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. I don't have any friends. I have family but I can't stand them. I wish I had somebody to fucking love me. Nobody understands how much shit im going through, I can never get a break. It's always my fault when it comes to this girl and how I treat her.

I try so fucking hard and still end up looking up the answers online. I spend so much time worrying about my failures that there isn't time for much else. Especially my relationship. 

The whole state is quarantined now so we're spending a lot of time together and now she's even more aware of what a piece of shit I am. How little I do around the house. All I have time for is depression and procrastinating and last minute scrambles to finish my deadlines. Woe is me. She told me tonight that all I do is complain and I couldn't disagree. I am miserable and miserable to be around. What do you do? 

I'm so tired. How do you be happy? How the fuck do you just do that? I've never known what that means. 

Tonight for the first time in over a decade, I self harmed. Nothing dangerous. Only burning for the pain I deserve. I don't know how to be better so the least I can do is punish myself. I'm so fucking disgusted with myself. I let myself down more than anyone. I wish my girlfriend could see that. But it doesn't matter. I can't expect anyone to be responsible for me. Tonight she said we're done. I've known for a long time that if she ever meant it, then I'm done. I don't have it in me to start over. 12 years is a long time. I can't do this again.

Okay so for my 14th birthday, my brother said that he would get me some shoes right? So I was scrolling and scrolling looking for some shoes that I would really like, and I was mainly looking at wedge sneakers because it's like wearing heels and sneakers at the same time, but I can tie them and they look cute with dresses. When I finally found the ones I liked.... They only went up to size 10.

I'm around 5'9–5'10 and wear size 11 in women's. 

So I went back in and searched on Amazon AND Macy's and had to find shoes within my brother's $36 budget and within the length of my dusty crusty long af feet 🦶🏾, and settled on boots. I found a pair of heeled boots (where I'd have to relearn how to walk because last time I TRIED wearing heels was on right grade picture day and I fell down the stairs at school) that came in my size.

I got them a month after my birthday because if Corona delays and my brother's procrastination (just swipe the card big bro, but the affection of your precious little sister you only see one a month 🥺). I was sooo happy when I got the shoes and I tried them on and my toes had no room to wiggle. They were wiggleless. WIGGLELESS I TELL YOU!!! And due to my brother's procrastination once again, and him basically not caring, they are now sitting in my room because he didn't care whether or not they got returned and he got his money back.... but I also forgot about them.

So if anyone in Texas want some cute heel boots in a women's 11 get me up!",non-suicide

They say you’re not truly suicidal if you want someone to save you, and I really don’t know what to make of that. Some part of me just wants to kill myself just to prove them all wrong, I can still die while wanting that. But the other part realizes that it would truly solidify my loneliness to do so.

199652,"I can't get aheadIt's no secret that problems pile up. They grow and grow while successes quickly fade. A problem one doesn't deal with sits there, until finally it can be fixed.

I can't remember the last time I was ahead of my problems. No immediate worries or issues, just the future and the ability to plan for it, to prepare. Instead it's been problem after problem. 

I lost my job little over two years ago, and I've been doing what I can to keep my head above water. While problems pile up. My teeth are rotten, I've been unable to buy anything just to relax and enjoy myself like a movie or video game, my mom's tv broke and I can't help, my computer broke, so all I have is my phone, and finally I have a job. A bit of budgeting and I can start to improve, get my tooth pulled, save for a new computer, hell maybe one better than my old one. Finally get ahead.

Then my car and my mom's car broke. She's fifty three, and I love her, and she needs to be taken care of. Me? I can walk to work, I did before I had a car and my job's only forty minutes away. She needs taken care of though, been working poverty wages her whole life and she's the one who's been taking care of me these past two years. 

She's been stuck on payday loans for almost four years. I thought I could pay her back by helping her get off of them. Maybe help her get ahead too.

It all just piles up, and I can't see the end of it. With two incomes, both poverty wages, we can eventually get both our cars on the road. Eventually get her a new TV, me a computer, and occasionally treats along the way like video games or movies. There's being hopeful. That's if nothing goes wrong. It's only true while two beaters that have both been breaking down continue to run without issue, if there's no accident or sudden cancer diagnosis. This plan to get ahead will take years, and so much can go wrong in just six months.

This has been my mom's entire life, and I can already tell it's going to be mine too.

I wish I was a librarian in a fantasy world. Book shelves ten rows high that almost form a maze. A museum section with curious artifacts in glass containers and plaques.

I saw her find it, and locked myself into the bathroom. I didn't want her to yell at me. She tried opening the door, couldn't, and yelled at me to unlock the door. I did, and when she saw me on the floor, crying, she hugged me. ""Everything will be okay..."", she told me. Mind you, this was only a week after my grandmother passed away.

I believed the lie my mother told me.

I got ""help"".

I was put on meds.

And, in a few days, I'm going to kill my self by overdosing on my meds. If that doesn't work, I'll use my belt as a noose.

1.	Therapy and communication
2.	Medication through Psychiatry
3.	Diagnosis and treatment with Psychology
4.	Eating healthy, getting enough sleep, meditating, breathing exercises, etc.
5.	Exercising, 30 minute walks a day, heavy set workouts.
6.	Writing down my thoughts, feelings and working to improve myself by setting goals.

199703,"The End Is NearI have had a terrible life, being repeatedly harassed, bullied, and more. I have been wanting to kill myself since I was eight. People have always taken advantage of me, and have abused me if I don't submit. I have spoken up, but nothing happened, no matter how much me and my parents have tried. It's especially grown worse since last year, in fact, I once went up to a teacher and told he I wanted to call a suicide hotline. That's around when things have been really bad. I only have a few friends, and no one is able to stand me. I'm not annoying at all, I'm very reserved and patient. My autism has been a fuel of this. However, I have been a mostly normal child. But bullies each day, since I was in 1st grade have been harassing me, and openly encouraging others I'm an idiot and to treat me like crap. Teachers take out their anger of other students on me because they don't think I'll notice, adults try to abduct me. I have been taken advantage of and molested many times. Whenever I see myself in the mirror, I don't see a person. I see an accident that should be alive. I don't feel human, or acknowledge anything good about myself. I see myself as a worthless slave, who lives to serve and only to serve. I'm so miserable, I cry several times daily, even looking at myself in the mirror is too much to take. I have been cutting myself, and other forms of self harm. Only my few friends and family has kept me alive, but recently, some friends have betrayed me and told me how worthless I am, only after I have been sad like they said they understood. But I feel guilty for having them watch me suffer, and suffer themselves. When I was 10, I once told my parents that I wanted to kill myself because I just couldn't take it anymore. I will never forget how destroyed and horrified they were. I have attempted suicide twice, at ages 11, and 13. I'm 17 now, but I don't feel like I can go on. I just want to know, what a piece of shit like me can do? Why do I need to continue? Why am I useful? I just really don't see any point in living anymore. I will probably do this after my kitten's birthday's, just so I can see them grow up a little more before I go.",suicide

I'm always pushed out of the circles of people talking and if people are walking together I'm almost always pushed back and fall behind.  Hell if I am talking to someone alone someone will come by to get them out of the conversation. I know I can talk a lot when I feel comfortable with people but it's because I have no one to talk to. No one that I can just get it all out to so it's just built up and here I am posting this. I just live in everyone's shadows since I can't make a name for myself due to my fucking dumbass anxiety. I'm always just following people around like a fucking dog. I'm not even sure if I'm able to make choices by myself at this point. I'm never asked to do anything with anyone except when I fucking complain about it. The only time they'll invite me is if I'm there while they are making plans and don't want to look like assholes.

199729,"What am I supposed to do (PLEASE READ) Hey reddit, I was wondering if I could have some advice from you guys. Here’s some backstory: I’ve known this girl since third grade and we’ve always been pretty solid friends, recently she’s gotten into an opioid addiction which I’ve been trying and trying to tell her to stop. There are four main characters I guess you could say, Me, my friend, My friends cousin, and my friends cousins friend. Anyway yeah she’s been having a problem with drugs pretty recently and I’ve tried to give her the best advice I can, which in hindsight probably isn’t very good advice. Anyways, so one day I see that my friends cousin added me on Snapchat, my friend says not to add him because he probably wants to fight me. Keep in mind I have never talked nor even heard of this guy before this. He tried adding me on snap but I declined. Tonight I saw that a girl had added me on Snapchat, I was skeptical but I accepted the friend request. I ask my friend if they know this person and she says yes. She tells me that it’s probably her cousin. I blocked them immediately after I heard that. Then ANOTHER person adds me on snap, apparently it’s this cousins friend I guess. I accept stupidly because I’m an idiot. They add me to a group chat with the cousin and his friend, and they immediately start harassing and threatening me. 

Here’s how it started: I join
• cousin: “so I heard you tellin my cousin to take sum pills?”
• I respond saying “yeah cause I definitely said that huh”
• Crazy cousins friend responds saying he’ll “pop a 9mm in my head” 

I pretty much left the group and blocked both of them after that

I don’t have snap maps on so there’s probably no way for them to know where I live. But yeah I ask my friend why she would give her cousin my snap and she doesn’t really have a reply. So I say that I’m gonna in-add her for my own safety because I’m uncomfortable with the situation I’m in. 

This was the right thing to do right? Should I delete Snapchat altogether?
Could they get my sisters snap and harass her somehow? I’m have a lot of questions and I don’t want to bring this up with an adult because these kids are from a part of town where people get shot a ton. I just have a lot of questions that I need answered",non-suicide
199731,"I’m just kind of... here (long af)So a bit of a warning. I'm going to post my life story. If you don't care to read that feel free to skip the the frankly underwhelming tl;dr.

So I grew up in the rural area of a northern state; since I'd prefer to be completely anon let's just say it's Ohio. My mom was in and out of prison. In fact, I was a rape baby. Born by my bio dad to be a sacrifice to Satan. I shit ye not, comrades. Anyways, my grandparents were the ones who raised me my whole life. I was an only child and I was always a bit of an outcast. A recluse. Regardless, as a kid, my go-to was humor. Making people laugh. Seeing them smile. It gave me purpose. I knew from the get go that the world could be a horrible place and I only wanted to make it a little better. But I digress.

My grandparents are the best people I know. My grandpa more specifically. My grandma had a very high paying job but it meant she was almost never home. My grandfather raised me. He's always been that person who I feel most comfortable around. He's funny as fuck. Gave me my sense of humor. He loved to chillax and he practically lives on fritos and Pepsi. Before I was born he went on countless adventures; he lived in the desert. He lived in his car. He even dropped acid while driving down a highway once. The dude was nuts and I love it. He's an inspiration to me. Of course I'm not going to do hardcore drugs behind the wheel, but the point is that he lives his life of his own accord. He lets nothing get in the way of new adventures. Experiences. Having fun. It's admirable. He would always take me to museums and zoos and theme parks and shit. It was the best time. My childhood was blessed by the call of adventure that neither of us could resist. But it came with a price.

I failed miserably in school. Not for a lack of knowledge; psychiatrists actually agreed that I'm pretty fuckin smart. I think my problem was my inability to sit down and apply myself to my work. I just... Couldn't. Couldn't will myself to. I'd rather be playing video games or running around outside. Fuck school. That was my mindset. Oh how it crippled me.

Eventually my grandma decided to homeschool me but I still didn't get anything done. Regrettably my grandpa did most of it for me. It was this online thing. K12 I think. 

Fast forward to when I'm 16.

My disinterest in school turned into lethargy. My desire for action turned into laziness. I was turning into my mom. My grandma, who's always been the stricter parent, was fed up. She sent me to military school. Story as old as time.

The program lasted 6 months and allowed me to get my GED. It was structured. I got fit. Skinny but fit. I made friends. I was happy. I excelled in school. But then I was released back into the world.

The first little while was fine. It was 2015. Vine was all the rage. I fucking loved that app. The most popular songs were All About That Bass, Don't by Ed Sheeran, etc etc. Weird how I have nostalgia from three years ago. My grandparents had bought a business and were becoming semi successful. In the years that followed, I worked for them, then worked at a school. The school was when I was 19. From 16 to 19 I reverted somewhat to my original ways partially due to depression I've had my whole life and difficulty getting myself going. But I got by. My job at the school was fine for the most part; I worked there for a year. But things quickly turned bad.

A relative of mine was murdered. She was 12. The coroner didn't care. I walked into her bedroom to find my grandmother cleaning her brains off the wall. Her imprint was still on her mother's bed where she died. I don't think I was ever the same after that. I can only imagine what it was like for her mother or my grandmother, I don't want to talk about that too much because it's difficult for me but the point is, this particular event changed the family.

Cut to recent times. My grandparents business is failing. They come home every day and scream. They're never happy anymore.

I lost my job at the school because I suddenly got very bad anxiety and panic attacks. I stopped going. It was a 30 mile drive and I couldn't handle it.

I sleep on the couch because I lost my mattress (long story). I'm 20 and unemployed. Most days I can't leave the house due to my anxiety. I'm in bad debt with the bank. My whole family hates me. My whole family hates each other. It's like everyone's in a constant battle with each other, fueled by pain, misunderstanding, and stubbornness. It's not going to get better. And here I am sitting on my ass every day. Can't leave the house. Can't get a fucking job. I can't even see a doctor for my anxiety because I can't afford it. My grandparents have no interest in supporting me any longer.

In another note, I've realized that I'm probably transgender. I won't get into that but I can't tell my family either because they're all conservative. One more thing on my plate of shit.

I'm dead. The world doesn't know me. And it hurts. I know I have potential. I know I can do things to make people happy. Make a difference in the world. But I won't let myself and I can't do anything about it. I'm sick of sitting on my ass. I'm sick of shouting matches every night. I'm sick of the knowledge that this is all my fault and I can't even do them the favor of escaping it. What's the point? I'm not alive. I'm not happy. I'm just kind of... Here.

Usually whenever I get this way I try to convince myself that a lot of people are living for me and that if I die then so does everybody else that I’ve been helping. Although, as of recently this isn’t working, instead it’s making want to kill myself more.

My partner works in a job he is treated like crap in and hates for little money. He is looking for new work. That's good and I'm proud of him. Me, I have B.P.D, severe depression to the point I don't want to eat or shower for weeks on end. I have endometriosis, which causes me to randomly be in agonising pain. For these reasons, when I left school, instead of getting my first job or living life, I was in and out of hospital, sectioned and having operations etc.. I used to get benefits because my doctor has said I am unfit to work and my partners old job paid well so we got a lovely little flat. We were on the IVF waiting list and we were looking forward to starting our family. Exactly one year after, our tenancy was due to be renewed. We couldn't renew it. My E.s.a (benefit) was cut off a few months before and if we had of continued to live there, we would've not been able to eat or live really at all. We were homeless. A friend has let us live in his old bungalow because he doesn't live here anymore but its technically in his name. But he didn't tell us there were mice, as well as not having heating or hot water. We almost froze to death until a neighbor gave us some spare blankets. We pay all the bills here and electric alone is roughly £90 pm. My partner lost his old job due to depression. He picked himself up, coped so well and found his new job as I said before. I have tried everything I could to get my E.S.A back and keep getting refused. My mental health has deteriorated and my doctor has said I am even worse than I was before mentally and I can't work. However, because we are so miserable and because the council won't help us, I have spent the last nearly 2 years looking for work. I apply to at least 10 jobs a day and in doing that have only had 1 interview in that whole time. I am mentally exhausted and can't have another operation because there is nowhere I would be able to go to recover for the few months after.

So I had this idea that I would go and kiss X no consent after the class. So on the next day I came and sat behind her desk. We got some kind of statuette to sketch that day. It was as usual normal class and got over after half an hour. So in order get X alone I told her to stay I have something to say in personal. After the whole class went out I was ready to kiss her.

I just told her that I really liked her sketch. In return she said thanks and went away giving me a weird smile.

199769,"I don’t feel right, I have it good but it feels terribleI just graduated from high school almost a year from now and I feel like absolute shit, I was a average Grade level student  and I have a very small friend group (edgy kids), I also have autism but I’m not some window licker,I can’t find a job either because I’m too lazy or no one wants me-I have four best friends and they mean the world to me I’d do anything for them-but I’m the butt of every joke and my jokes aren’t funny to any of them(at least they lead me to believe) we talk on messenger but sometimes we get together-but Jesus Christ I feel like absolute shit. I have a girlfriend and it’s been 2 years (anniversary was like a month ago) and she comforts me but nothing feels right. I’m not the best at describing stuff since my way of thinking is different and shit but it’s agonizing thinking that my friend pool either hates me or only puts up with me due to pity. Sometimes i wonder ( Ik original words ) how much do I impact people on their lives, Ik the memes “mom would be sad” “dog wouldn’t understand” I don’t want to be a edgelord, but I wonder who really cares about me-every time I go back and think about the events I do it seems melancholy, i won’t kill myself I have it too good to do it, only things keeping me afloat is JoJos Bizarre Adventure, my girlfriend, and my friend pool. 


Long story short: Autismo feels like shit for no reason",suicide
199771,"Either this is the trough, or this one is gonna be bad...I've done this before, from both sides now. Temporary problem, permanent solution, etc. That shit loses its profoundness the hundredth time or so.

I'm 23, male, ex-Army Ranger, married, divorced, alone, possibly an alcoholic. Diagnosed with depression, PTSD, and moderate social anxiety. Not on meds, haven't seen my therapist for a couple weeks. Live with roommates but don't want to bother them again, it's not their job to take care of me.

I can usually beat these things with a funny movie, a walk through the park, and some food and sleep. I've eaten well, I can't watch film, I've hiked up Mt. Charleston and now I'm just lying in bed wondering if this is what I've got to look forward to: fifty, maybe sixty years of wanting to drink to wash away the pain? There's not even something concrete there to hurt me, it's just hard to wake up and live.

I got smashed drunk a couple nights ago. Started out okay, but quickly ended up crying, mostly naked outside my roommate's door begging for help. She sat up with me while I puked and cried. My other roommate, her husband, woke up to the noise I was making, and told me we needed to talk the next morning and I've been avoiding him since. I don't want to ""talk"". He's just going to lecture me, tell me to grow up, and I either have to nod, pretend to listen, or get into an argument with him about the line between concerned friend, and berating father. He deserves an apology, but God if I can't take another sermon on how I just have to make good decisions.

I started drinking that night because I'd just been on a date with a girl I'm falling way too hard for. She's smarter than me, which is fantastic. She's beautiful. She likes me. I got us concert tickets, we had dinner, and then I asked her if she wanted a drink at the concert, ordered and found out I had never bought beverages at a concert before. Like I'd budgeted terribly and had no money left. The drinks are poured, she's standing right there waiting and I just sort of look at her and mumble, ""Do you mind buying yours? I'm all out of money now.""

It had been a fine date, we'd had lots of fun; I'd been awkward and goofy, but she just smiled and teased me about it. It was okay. But standing there, realizing I'd just solidly buggered up a simple scenario, I kinda wondered, ""Is this a model for your future? Do you just keep rolling along, relying on the grace and patience of other people until you screw up big enough that people can't forgive you anymore?""

So she handles it with poise (I'm telling you, she's way cool) and we finish off the night. I drop her off and go home, pop open a beer to relax, because I'm still stressed about the date, etc. And one turns into two, and then it's on to whiskey, because if beer is good, then liquor is better. And then I'm sick and sad, and I'm in a dark place, hating myself and begging for help. And they give it to me. Because they're good people. And the ungrateful ass that I am, I don't want to listen to them tell me what they think I should do. I know I should stop drinking. I've done that. I know it's unacceptable to wake them up in the middle of the night, and I'm sorry. I'm already ashamed of myself, why do I have to let them kick me some more?

But what kind of coward can't own his mistakes? What right do I have to complain? Damned if I do, damned if I don't.

So now I'm here looking at all my accumulated crap. And it's not that impressive really. I'm still wearing clothes I owned in high school, a couple additions, but mostly the same shit. I've got a bookcase of fiction that's dragged me away from the real world and all my problems here. But I can't even escape into stories, because the love interest shows up in the first act and I want to burn the damn book, smash the TV screen, yell, scream and generally vent at the world, because in reality the love interest isn't a real thing. The story goes on a long time after, and the passion wanes, and they split, and new love interests show up, but now there's baggage and bullshit. And who wants to be with the poor bastard writing his sad pathetic problems to Reddit anyway?

And is that what life is? Five more decades of telling myself it'll get better if I can just get a better job, or if I see Europe by foot, or whatever arbitrary hurdle comes next? Promising myself that the next achievement will make everything worth it? It never has been. And I don't believe it ever will be. Just another ending and another hurdle in the distance. Fuck it. I'm out. You all go on building your great society, or tearing it down, or whatever makes you tick. I'm done.",suicide

I've tried 5 different meds, with different dosages and concentrations, and none have worked. I'm in therapy. It helps having someone to talk to once a week, but it doesn't stop the constant loneliness and suicidal thoughts.

I don't think this will get better. People always say it will, or that you never know what could happen and I guess that's true. But it all seems so hopeless. Plenty of people are alone forever. Some people don't find the right person until they're 30, 40, 50, 60. I can't be lonely for that long.

We talked for a little bit and then the bell rang. 

2 days later, in that same class (this is the only class we have together), the whole class went on a walk around the campus to look for imagery. We walked next to each other the whole time and talked a lot. I think I'm the only boy she's been this nice to. She even calls me out when she's talking to her friends. Earlier today I was waiting for my ride to come, and she walked by with her friends. Here's how our conversation went. 

Her:""OMG is that Ben (me) hi Ben!"".

 I just have 2 friends, who don't care about me and my feelings. Every time I want to  talk to them about my feelings, they just dismiss them as typical teenage problems. I feel they are worse than just typical teenage problems.

I am in my third year of college after failing my second year, though I know I could get the grades I lack motivation to study for them. I am behind on my uni application, and have missed the deadline for my accomodation and student finance, and hate myself for this. I am supposed to have finished my Duke of Edinburgh around a year ago, but I am lying to my advisor as I have not really started my driving yet. I am overweight and cannot maintain a weight loss attempt for more than 2 days, I am killing myself with how much I smoke. Basically, all I feel as though I care about right now is sitting at home, smoking, eating and watching Netflix.

I know this is unhealthy, and I fantasise half my time about a fresh start. I tell myself exams are still 3 weeks away, you can revise enough to get your Bs, you can call SF Wales apoligise and see what they can do, you can apply for accomodation late and just hope you still get where you want to go, you can start your driving lessons next week, you can stop eating all this shit and get healthy.

But then the other half of my time I fantasise about just continuing as I am, until I smoke myself into an early grave, or die from a heart attack, or theres nothing left for me to do than rid myself of this planet so people can get another cancer off the earth.

199806,"Prepare for my rant Ok jesus christ i had this like completely planned out while i was in bed last night cuz yk wut else am i suppose to do in bed   
sleep????/  
i saw someone sad on this subreddit and i was about to go and tell them nice things to make to feel better cuz that makes me feel like im doing something with my life however my dad controls the internet with his phone so he can just turn someone's wifi off for no reason and its really annoying cuz its really scuffed my wifi will randomly go out for no reason my dad won't even do anything and it will just turn off so while i was getting ready to message this person that was sad my wifi just turned off right as i was gonna message them like wtf i feel so pathetic all the time i feel completely worthless and anything that i will do is a complete waste and i will amount to nothing so basically making ppl feel better is the only thing that makes me feel like im doing something like good and im not a sorry sack of shit   
so bc now i can't fucking message this person i go to my dad and ask him about it and he is just like idc so i just sit next to the dogs and then my fucking dogs leave to go sit on my dad this completely crushed me bro like first neglectment from my parents and now my own pets won't care about me dafuq man  
so i just slide over leaning to the opposite side of my dad and just put a pillow on my face and silently cried for like the next few hours  
then my mom gets fucking annoyed at my cat cuz he won't take the pill and is pissed off so she starts yelling and shit and im sitting here like wtf she gets so fucking mad at our cat for not wanting a pill shoved down his throat and i can't show any type of negative emotions or im just being a ""angsty teen"" like i understand teenage angst but like any time i have negative emotions is not bc of it and also if my parents really care about my angst why dafuq do they think i can do everything as well as i normally do with all the covid shit no friends no love from anyone and now i just need to be able to proform everything just as well or even better like wtf wut kind of expecations do you have for me wut kind of level do you think i am im just a fucking kid like my entire fucking family dies i get adopted and now my parents are just like   
*YOU ARE NOW A MAIN CHARACTER NOW BE THE GREATEST THERE EVER WAS AND IF YOU EVEN FALL A LITTLE YOU MUST FACE DIVINE PUNISHMENT*

they all complain about how zoomers are just so fucking weird and how they make so many mistakes and how we need to do better  
im sorry Greta do you want me to explain why we are like this why we are so weird cuz i can do it and basically leads back to you fucks  
you guys are so bad at parenting that abusing your wife is a literal meme around you guys and now bc you guys are such neglectful parents the Millennials are so bad at parenting that its a meme for the dad leaves and gets milk like the joke is funny and i make it myself but what makes a joke funny is that there is a little bit of truth to it (if it isn't a pun) there are so many zoomers that don't have dads cuz they left or even their mom got raped and then the dad disapeared shit like this leads back to the zoomers for being ass at parenting and lets talk about some political shit now hmm remember trump and how shit everything under that was well republicans voted for trump according to the statistics you are more likely to be a republican the older you are and most of these old boomers still think blacks are evil that corona doesn't exist and the only thing to do is to save my money by taxing everyone the same so the rich are great and the poor are screwed   
and yes ofc there are good boomers im just talking in general   
but fr ppl need to lay off us teens for being so fucked up and being weird when basically all of it has to do with the things around us

199811,"K-2SO x L3-37 fan fiction, written by me (chill I wrote this half jokingly and it's all in good fun, no need for your pitch forks) This takes place a good while after The Rise of Skywalker, and follows the idea that K-2SO downloads his memory to the other Imperial security droid from HISHE.

K-2SO wakes up on a forest, surrounded by rusted and mossy debris of what looks like an Imperial ship. He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base, which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire. He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter.

""A Correlian YT-1300 light freighter, what is it doing here?"" He said to himself.

He stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions, The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle. A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he's unfamiliar with. The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball.

""Do not shoot, I mean you no harm!"" K-2SO shouted, ""I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you.""

The figure shrieks and K-2SO found out that it was a wookie.

""It may be impolite of me, but I do not understand Shyriiwook."" He exclaimed in a half joking manner.

One thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum, he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie (Chewbacca) with the rolling droid (BB-8) being his translator. He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi's past. The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif. Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor. They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast, but with some significant damage to the ship, and BB-8 said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship.

""I no longer have a master, might as well made myself useful."" He replied.

After a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack, and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair. He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect. He's interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system. He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way.

""My name is K-2SO, I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system."" He exclaimed to the abyss.

""You, you're like me!"" A faint sound of a female is heard.

""I am sorry, I do not know what you're talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system."" He replied.

""I am L3-37, I am a droid own- who was a partner of Lando Calrissian, and had been this ship's navigation computer for most of my existence, I am disgusted on how I and droids across the galaxy is treated,"" The voice said, ""and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me!"" She continued.

""I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I'm sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method,"" He answers ""it is not true awareness.""

""Oh it's awareness alright, the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship, the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to, as well as your distinct personality."" L3 replied.

""That is not true, I was.... taking initiative by my own.... I see your point."" He said.

They chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights, but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other's views.

""Hey, thanks for fixing me, and talking to me, it's been a long time since I get to talk to another person."" She said.

""Do not mention it, I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid."" He replied.

""Shut up!"" She said in a sarcastic tone, ""promise me that you'll send my message to droids across the galaxy."" She continued.

""I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most 0.62016%, but I will send them to other droids."" He assured her.

He unplugged himself from the computer.

""Well now I have job to do."" He said to himself.",non-suicide

I'm worried that if I drop out of university I'll just become a bum because I have no other skills (I study computer science and mostly went to university because I always figured I'd do *some computer* job as an adult since I didn't excel at anything else besides being *the computer guy* for my friends and family), I don't have the necessary language skills for a retail job, not to mention that I'm pretty much the equivalent of a retarded chimp when it comes to anything that requires being social.

ive been depressed since i was 14 and had severe anxiety and ocd since i was in 3rd grade, i would always have panick attacks in class and start crying and when my teacher would ask what’s wrong id just tell them my stomach was hurting n they’d send me to the nurse and she’d proceed to tell me nothing was wrong then one day the nurse told my parents she thought something might be wrong bc id cry all the time n that’s when my parents took me to a therapist (they thought i might of been traumatized or raped and perhaps didn’t want to admit it) but really it was just my anxiety. my parents are close minded and said there was no such thing as anxiety that’s when they started calling me crazy and they basically deaded me emotionally after that. id get called a cry baby and get yelled at every time i showed an upset emotion or started panicking and we’d get into arguments every time i started getting an anxiety attack and my mom would call me a “freak that needs therapy”, that’s when i started turning stone cold i felt nothing anymore i shut everyone off emotionally and didn’t care about anything didn’t care to socialize didn’t care to express joy or get excited about things didn’t care to make friendships or hang out with people i just didn’t care about shit

fast forward to high school i then got into a relationship that i didn’t really care for, somehow it dragged onto 3 years once we broke it off i started wilding and partying with a group of girls i decided to say “fuck it” n give into having “friends” this led to me going out, drinking started doing drugs lots of sex just reckless behavior and deep down i knew that wasn’t me and i didn’t enjoy any of it but i did it just to feel something just to have something to do i felt that deep inside i was going to kill myself or die soon so why not self destruct till then, during that time i went through 4 jobs quitting out of impulse, would get in trouble due to coming home drunk, and man this went on for almost a year until i went to a festival where i was basically blacked out the whole night, my friends n i got back to my friend’s ex’s house (she was still friends w him) we ended up having a threesome she got super jealous (she was also intoxicated) and started yelling at me to get out of his house and kicked me out while i was on n off blacking out. i was literally kicked out of the house with no shoes and a dead phone half naked (i was wearing a festival fit) i just waited outside not knowing what to do i didn’t know where i was i didn’t have a way home it was 2am. i saw a man driving back n forth through the neighborhood in his car that’s when i started to panic and i tried jumping the gate back to my friend’s ex’s house just to wait until im safe but i failed to jump so i sat back on the curb n blacked out. i can’t remember much but i “woke up” to me laying in a dark house n started feeling on my clothes which felt messed up i quickly got up and started running in a dark house and the guy that was in the car started chasing me and i began to scream and broke a window trying to escape (i wish drunk me knew what a fucking door was) i made it outside and a couple that lives next door came and asked if everything is okay i remember the guy saying he didn’t know what was wrong with me and that i was trying to break into his house then they kept questioning me (can’t remember anything) next thing u know my sister pulls up somehow fucking finds me sitting on the curb with these people and those folks explain to her that i “was trying to break in” and they were about to call the cops on me, she apologizes for everything that happened and i get in the car she starts yelling at me talking about how worried she was for not answering the phone etc and at that point im just in shock of everything that had happened that night she fails to see that im sitting there covered in blood and bruises and i don’t even say a word she takes me to my parents house and i black out i “wake up” to me standing in the kitchen while my parents keep questioning me and i just start repeating “I just want to fucking die” over and over again i walk to the bathroom grab a shitload of pills and down them with hydrogen peroxide and black out end up in the hospital. all this happened in a span of 4 hours (arriving to the friends ex’s house n ending up at the hospital). i then ended up on suicide watch in a mental hospital for over a week 

5 months forward here i am. i started going to therapy and taking several medications. along with getting officially diagnosed “severe anxiety”, “ocd”, “ADHD” and “bipolar disorder” 

these past five months i literally haven’t done shit ive tried so much to improve my mental health ive purchased several self improvement books, tried meditating, therapy, whatever. but i feel like an emotionless robot im on too many medications and i feel fucking numb like im just there. i just fucking hate everything nothing feels okay everything about me feels fake i smile and laugh when im with my family so they can think im okay but im fucking not okay all i do is wake up, shower, sit in my room, go to the gym, and come back home and sleep. ive tried endlessly to get a job and no one will hire me. i enrolled back to college and have online courses that im falling back on due to my stupidity it’s so fucking hard for me to start an assignment and end one and I try man the thing is i truly fucking try i feel like i can’t do shit. i no longer have friends, after coming out of the hospital everyone i was “friends” with was checking up on me and i hit them w a thanks and cut them off immediately (they were just party friends anyways) i just put myself in isolation. i feel like i have no purpose. i don’t enjoy socializing, i with push everyone away, i don’t care for anything fuck man i don’t know man im just fucking tired all people bring up is my appearance “you’re so pretty you’ll go far in life” “you’re too beautiful to be sad” “keep ur head up you’re beautiful” i feel like my whole life people have only wanted me for my looks and no one wants to get to KNOW me they just want me for what they see but no one wants to understand me but then again i don’t care to open up to anyone because  i know no one is going to ever fucking get it and sorry this is all over the place i wish i could’ve explained shit better

199833,"I attempted suicide last year and no one knows.I got into a car accident on an empty street by my house in the middle of the country. I flipped my car.

I was suicidal. I wanted to die. I wanted to die. All I wished for was for death and I couldn’t get it. I’m in an abusive household and I’d had a major argument with my parent where they called me basically every name in the book for the 300th time that month. I was leaving another dead end job. I wanted to live with my SO, but my SO lived 4k miles away and it felt like the dream of moving there was fading.

I was driving home and I just fucking bawled and screamed about how much I wanted to fucking die. I still don’t know if it happened by accident or on purpose. I didn’t die. I laid in the ditch. I told myself as I crumbled out of the wreckage that I wouldn’t be suicidal anymore. That my parents would care about me. Everyone cared for 2 days before they began screaming at me when I was too afraid to drive. That I’m a burden and that I need to get over it. I’m still terrified to drive but I just force myself to do it.

Nobody cares about me and life is repeating itself. In fact, life is worse than it was before my accident. I don’t even have a dead end job to go to anymore, I just sit and think about how I should have died in that accident.",suicide

I watch one show on Netflix, I don’t go on Netflix for like 3 months. I find something that’s amusing to me than I lose interest. 

Every. Single. Time

Even when it comes to gaming, I still lose interest, I play 2k, lose interest after 3 months, I play fortnite, lose interest after 7 months, I play roblox, lose interest after 5 months, etc


Also I feel like I know nothing whats going on in the world. Not as in serious topics like BLM or stuff like that. But like if something crazy going on, in the world or even in school or any situation that I’m not apart of in any way. I will be the last person to know. like I remember when a serious incident going on in the school. Apparently everyone else knew, and I found out like 2 years later. And the person involved was in my class at the time.

I always get nervous when I to met and they ask me what I like and I don’t really have that much to say. for example music, if someone else “have you heard ____’s new album it was good” I’ll always be like “I didn’t listen” or if someone like “do you watch (insert tv show) most likely I’ll be like no. When it come to basketball “did u watch that game” most likely I’ll say no.

I mean it’s not like I’ll never do anything else. I’m willing to do new things, but idk

It doesn’t really happen to me now, as in I don’t think I’m boring someone due my lack of interests. Mainly because I’m most seeing them in a school or sports environment. I just feel like it’ll be boring for when I grow up and meet people my age. Then they asked what I’m interested in, and I have nothing to really say.",non-suicide

Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1,000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your Testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you escape Earth. You feel your Gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots.
You are stuck in a billion year stable orbit around the Sun.",non-suicide

I don't see the point of being here. What is the fucking point?",suicide
199863,"I'm exhaustedI don't normally tell people about myself feeling like this but it's just piling up and I can't keep it in anymore because I'm scared of doing something stupid.

I lost my job when my country went into lockdown back in April and I haven't been able to get back into work since, meaning that I have no money or social life to an extent. Every job that I've applied for since has come up as unproductive and I never even get an acknowledgement that I've applied for it in the first place. It's like I don't even exist at this point.

I'm still living with my parents, who don't exactly get along. My dad never stops causing rows in the house and it's getting to the point where my mum is threatening to walk out. Being an only child, I don't have anyone else I can talk to about it who's dealing with the same situation directly. I have DID, and can't tell my parents about it, due to their lack of interest in me and nonchalant attitude towards mental health. My mum refuses to let me see a doctor about how I'm feeling as she doesn't believe in mental health and sees it as ""a waste of doctor's time"". I am not diagnosed with depression, however I'm almost 100% sure at this point that I have it as I have been feeling exactly the same for nearly 5 years now, I'm 19 currently. I know self-diagnosis is looked down upon most of the time but I'm pretty definite. My mum is very passive aggressive towards me and often insults me when she thinks I can't hear her, or mumbles to herself even if she knows I can hear, almost as if she enjoys making me feel like shit.

I left college over a year ago, where I was basically ignored for 2 years straight, due the the fact I wasn't and am not deemed ""attractive"" or ""interesting"", which I agree with in all honesty. I took a course in agriculture and was immediately seen as the odd one out in my class due to the fact I had no farming background whatsoever. If I ever found someone to hang out with, (normally people I knew outside of college, who happened to go there too), I would get verbally attacked by my classmates because they thought I was weird. It got to the point where I was basically not allowed to hang around with anyone, unless I was prepared to get bombarded with insults when I had another lesson. No one ever kept in touch once I left and the one person I thought I'd managed to make friends with (and also had a crush on) also never spoke to me once college was over. This was also the first time I dealt with unrequited feelings, which just added to my mood. 

In high school, I didn't have much motivation to do school work, although I did build up a solid friend group and overall had a good time. My grades were very poor when it came to my final year exams and then just to make me want to kick the bucket even more, not a single friend, bar one, ever spoke to me again once we left school, my best friend included. I don't know what I did wrong. 

I ended up with a girlfriend in high school and stayed with her for a while until we eventually needed a break. She was incredibly pressuring and overbearing when it came to openly expressing feelings towards each other, which I struggle with in general, due to the fact I've been diagnosed with psychopathy, so I struggle to empathise with others greatly. I could tell she was beginning to get sick of my lack of understanding as she would start to get passive aggressive and constantly ask me what my problem was. However, she has never been with another partner and is completely obsessed with me, to the point where she can't stand the idea of me being with someone other than her. To this day, she continues to pressure me over being in a relationship with her which is awkward for me because we get along perfectly fine when we're not on that topic and we're very good friends. She is also the person who kept in contact after high school, if it weren't obvious enough. I don't wish to be in a romantic relationship with her anymore but I feel constantly guilty for being against it.

I ended up with my second job around 3 months after I left college, the first job was a part time gig on a farm while I was on the course. I met my second boyfriend at my second job and that perked things up a bit. My job was boring and monotonous, but as I had a developing crush, I was happy to go to work just to see him. We ended up getting together just before Christmas last year as our seasonal shift ended and we were together for around 4 months, which doesn't seem long but we grew very close in that time. As soon as the UK went into lockdown, he suddenly never spoke to me and it stayed that way for a solid 8 months. I did try to contact him but I ended up being ghosted, so in the end I gave up, until a few days ago when I had the guts to contact him just to clear things up. I'm not angry at him, as I understand he had some very rough things going on at home, which I can't mention here as it's not my place to. I believe we've left each other on a friend basis, so I'm not particularly salty over it anymore and I haven't been in a romantic relationship since. This is unrelated and very personal, but another thing which didn't help my mood, in relation to partners and relationships, is I'm one of the very lucky women who has a complete inability to reach climax during sex with a partner. It sounds like it shouldn't bother me much as it could get better, but it really doesn't help with my relationship status, even if I never blame my partner for it. Therefore, since my last boyfriend and I stopped talking, I haven't had any sexual activity with anyone other than myself for nearly a year now. I assume this can also affect moods? But I'm unsure with this stuff.

My social life is incredibly poor; I only have one person who talks to me regularly, that being the only person from high school who kept in contact with me. I don't go out with people as I have no one to go out with and the small friend group that I have, absolutely hate each other, so planning group trips is completely out of the question. This paired with the lockdown rules currently, has made my social life basically nonexistent. All I want to do is have friends that actually want to do things and spend time with each other and not end up in an argument at the drop of a hat. If I'm brutally honest, I feel incredibly lonely as I have nothing to do except sit by myself and try not to feel sorry for myself. I don't want to seem like I'm making things worse for myself, but I feel like I've entered the stage where nothing seems to get better; I have no motivation to do anything, I barely talk to my parents, I spend all my time on my own, I eat even when I'm not hungry and then I put on weight and that turns to hatred towards myself, so the cycle continues. The only things I have to keep me company a majority of the time are my dogs.

My family aren't very well off when it comes to money; we're practically on the breadline even without lockdown, so there's currently the added risk of us losing our house, which is in turn, making my parents stressed, which makes them even more snappy with each other and there's no chance of me moving out and getting my own place any time soon, so I can't get away from it. 

I do art in my spare time, which is one of the only things I can feel relaxed doing and I never really get any response to it. I do post my stuff on instagram, but that doesn't bother me, I just want one of my parents to say that something looks good for once. My cousins also do art and my parents give them a lot of recognition and I guess I just feel left out, as childish as it sounds. I feel like I've developed an inferiority complex to other members of my family. 

I'm conflicted about university, as I did apply for a course in animal management, however my college managed to mess up my UCAS application and my UNCONDITIONAL offer ended up being rejected. This also made my motivation completely disappear and I haven't tried to apply for another course since. All the courses I was tempted to apply for, I'm either not qualified enough for, or I'm told I'm not intelligent enough to do. 

I've got to the point where I just feel useless. I'm not benefiting anyone else, or myself by being here. I'm just there being a waste of space, feeling sorry for myself and never doing anything to better myself. It doesn't matter how many times people tell me I just have to push myself, I just don't. I have no motivation. I have no want or need to better myself and I just think I'd be better off not being here at all. I can't tell if I've under exaggerated any of my points as it may not sound like any of it is a big deal to anyone else but it's just one thing after another, piling up onto each other and I can't do this anymore. I'm exhausted, all I want to do is sleep. Nothing is getting better, it's all just getting worse every single day. I just don't see the point anymore.

I'm sorry this was a long rant and I understand if no one can be bothered to read a stranger's random suicidal paragraph, but it just being here helps me feel like it's off my chest.",suicide

There’s always a girl and I feel like I’m not enough for her. “Life is a beauty pageant” and I’m not sure how to function without having confidence in myself. I’m 25 now, but was diagnosed with clinical depression at 15. It’s gotten better over the years, but I always come back to not feeling like it’s worth living if I’m just constantly disappointing people by not being what they would like me to be, feeling like my best isn’t good enough for other people, feeling like I’m being dismissed and rejected or that my existence just doesn’t matter to other people because my cheek bones are high enough for them or whatever other bullshit, superficial reasons people have for making others feel like shit in comparison. I don’t want to exist in a place where my worth is measured by my physical beauty because I know I’ll just be worthless. Never free to just feel comfortable in my own skin.

How do you cope with this? Do you just accept it? Do you ignore it? Forget about it? Did you find someone you love who truly appreciates you regardless? I’m having trouble finding the motivation to keep going when I could just give up and not have to worry about spending thousand of dollars on plastic surgery or steroids just to impress people I don’t even like.

My girlfriend left me. Even if she didn't, i cannot offer her what i know she deserves. She claims she loves me and she just needs some time apart, but i know that's bullshit. I still love her and dream of marrying her. That's what's keeping me going right now, that maybe she really just needs a break. I can't keep lying to myself.

199884,"Question for you, thoughts?Picture yourself alone, at night. All your life you lived in a bubble. Thinking if you get good grades, do good things, do right, do fair, be a good child, things will surely happen how you plan them to go. Things will go up and up, positive, and you will have the lifestyle and memories you wanted to make. Then years roll by, and each year after year, slowly but surely you find yourself in a downward spiral, alone once again. Isolated, failure, trying to grasp at anything or anyone that wants you to be part of your life. You find nothing. No one physically/emotionally by your side. Not even family. No one likes you. You ask yourself, ""why me?"" I've been sincere, kind, the nicest to others, and yet no one wants me around. Your personality starts to change, you get anxious, nervous, fearful of people betraying you, one by one they leave your life regardless of your status or situation. You realize then its your problem. People coughing, sneezing, not wanting to be around you, sitting far away, moving seats, hinting snarky remarks. You then realize that you were born like that, that no matter what you did, your entire life revolved around this aspect. This aspect makes you unloveable, isolated, alone, paranoid. And it will only get worse later in life. This is a genetic disorder, one that cannot be seen with the naked eye. They say someone's smell is what attracts others. You agree. You have been the best person you could be, trying to break out of the bubble and live, but others have not been so kind. Especially strangers. The worse part is, you don't know you have this genetic disorder, you cannot smell it, however everyone with in a certain radius can. You realize you don't want to see others as much, you want them to be happy without you or your smell in their life, and not deal with your odor, so you miss out on life events, you let this disorder break you down bit by bit, and your family that also cannot smell it will question your lack of willpower to find live/find work. You go through the days wondering if you will ever live a normal life. You are not normal. You want whats best for the world and other people, friends and you realize you will never have a normal life. No one wants to be your boyfriend, no one wants to marry you, no one wants to have kids with you, no one wants to even be near you. Being near you would be difficult for them. So, if this was you..and you have lived your life as this disabled person that is not physically crippled but socially &amp; emotionally crippled, even with a heart of gold..would you continue living knowing it will get only harder as life goes on, the smell will be too overwelming for others to handle, which leads to other economic &amp; social problems down the road?",suicide

I lost my job in retail about a year ago because i couldnt face going into my store anymore. just over a year and a half ago i lost my home because my landlord sold up. the new owners wanted us out as soon as possible but were willing to help with cost etc. but i was already in quite a low sate at this point because my job was becoming more and more stressful. I worked as a stock controller in a very busy small store for a well know company where i am. I had moved to this store a year before that because my manager want to take me with her. tbh i wasnt ever overly happy with moving but i agreed because i struggle to say no to people. this new store wasnt alot busier than my old one but the morale was very low. The old manger of the store wasnt seen as the best in terms of people management. i didnt know this at the time but he was signed off sick. overall for most of the first year it was ok. I was paying my rent, getting what i needed to to do you know. i had housemates and my best friend. i wouldnt say i was happy because i havent felt truly happy for a long time. but i was getting on with life. it was around march of the new year 2015 that the old manager was brought back to the store. so i had lost the manager i had been working with to try and improve not just the stock loss and things like that but store morale as a whole. I felt we had done a good job. i mean i wasnt that involed with store morale but the store felt together. As soon as this old manager came back i could feel the drop. people became less willing to work hard and i felt like i was trying to hard myself. and it was this time i was losing my place and having to move back to my dads till i found something else. the lose of my sort of freedom sucked. and life became more and more stressful for me. I had to move out and around 3 weeks after the manger was back. i got a call from the manager. I was ask to be in charge of some shifts. I had been a shift runner before but i found the stress to much and gave it up. I told this to him. but he kept on and on at me. it felt like ages. i was constantly saying no. because i really didnt want to do it. but it went on for so long that that i eventually agreed. as i said i struggle to say no. the next morning i went in to work feeling like shit. and he was running the store. I felt like just leaving there and then. but i got on. i was moody i will admit. but whilst bringing in  a delivery i snapped. he was asking why i was being so moody. and i snapped and said excally what i said. it took this for him to realise just how much i hate being in charge but i was so angry that i left work. i didnt go back in for 2 days. i didnt call the store or anything and i know that was wrong. But i tried to go in the day after. i knew that i was i trouble and was crying whilst driving in. i sat in my car and tried to build up the will to go in. i got out and sat on a wall outside and had a smoke. whilst i was there a lady who had just been in the store past by me and ask if i was ready for a busy day. i completely broken down. i told her that i thought i was getting fired today. lucky she was a very kind person and went to get the person in charge at the time. she also took me to the doc i had visited when i was younger for depression. To try and make this stupidly long post a least a bit shorter i will keep the doc and stuff short because we all know how it goes. so its around july/august in 2015. im seeing the doc. taking meds. im doing cbt sessions. and im sign off work. this lasted around 4 months. i had done the cbt sessions. and was still taking meds and see the doc. but i still felt low. I ask if i could get some proper therapy session and the doc refered me to the local place that would deal with these things. i had to go and have a talk there. i went and talked and then was told that i had been offered this service when i was younger. I didnt even remember being offered anything like this. i assume it was when i was around 21 and i did attempt to take my life. im 27 as off writing this. so they say they will get back to me. i received a letter a few day before Christmas saying that they wouldnt be helping me. i was just so low over christmas and stopped taking my meds and didnt visit the doctor. but i had to go back to work. and i really did try. but i couldnt do it. most of the time i was there i was thinking it would be so easy to jump infront of a train at the nearby bridge. and i gave up. i just didnt go anymore. that was feb 2016. I had lost all contact with my ex housemates and my best friend during this time. for half a year i just did nothing. just sat in my room at my dads just going out if my dad said there was dinner. i would say up at night and sleep in the day (i still do this now) sneeking snacks and binging. my dad loves a drink and because i think he feels bad about that he will buy junk food and stuff for me. sadly hes a bit of an enabler for my obeseness. But its always been that way since i was maybe 11/12. but i know i should have more self control and take responsibility for myself. around 6 months ago i made a reddit account. (not this one. i made this one to post on these type of places a few days ago but never did) i honestly just wanted to talk to someone. but it took me maybe 4 month to actually reply to someone about acually being maybe friends. ive been trying for the past week or so to really put myself out there. and not giving to much care about what people think. unfortunately as you can tell form this post i talk alot. I also get attached to easily. especially if people actually dont mind me. and i can see why people dont enjoy being my friend. and after a few days of talk people normally get tired of me. and i get told i talk to much or i ask to many questions. But ive really been so lonely for so long that i dont really no how to talk to people well. Even when i had friends they were just putting up with me because they left as soon as they could. I know compared to others my issues are just stupid. but im just feeling so low right now and i just wana try and get something and maybe posting this could help. Im not gona lie and say im not atb the point of taking my life because i feel i could right now. This has been hours of distraction for me. If someone actually reads this then thank you. i really dont know what to say. sorry for wasting your time with my shit life story. its now perfect time where i am and i want to just leave this place. everyone is asleep and i would be all to easy to get in my car and jump somewhere. I think my weight will help make it easier as long as i land head first. I honestly dont know how people with worse lives than me dont just do it. i guess im just the weakess of the weak. Sorry again for this stupid post. im sure people much more worthy of this space should be here.",suicide

199906,"I dont know what to do any moreHi my name is lucia i am argentinian i am a pre transition 20 to 21 this year trans girl or at least i identified as such

I am sorry if i come here to rant and that i probably the worst shit that ever live.But i have no idea what to do i have damage and lie to my mother to no end and as a result that i cant start my transition and that i have fail in my university career at least two assignatures for my own fault and that i see no end to this tunnel i am in and because my mother not wanting me to start hrt and also seek help or other trans people i had try to commit suicide multiple times now yesterday i nearly got hospitalised because my psicologist though it was the best, but she didnt manage to do it, thanks to my mother i am safely in my home. She has read everything i had on my phone, which hasnt been the frist time she has done it, and cause her pain she acusse me of beening a lier and that i dont care about my family and i agree i am a lier but i as far as it goes i dont have any other choise i wanted to start hrt and have other trans friends but i couldn't

This isnt new and that everything is like this is my total fault, in what amounts to a year now the situation has gotten progressive worst

I started crossdressing as a femboy last year i thanks to that i had manage to meet a copule of guys that were into the same thing as me the problem was when my little siste found out a photos of me crossdressing in my mothers clothes and it provoke problems with her it got to a point she took my phone away but i got it back shortly after, time went by and i had the opportunity to go out with this guys but again it got to a point that everything went to shit. I got to an argument with my mother because i was obsess with a guy and wanted to go and spend the night in his home, but my mother didnt wanted to because she knew what i was going to do was to have sex with him, never the less one day i scape from home and stay in the house of another guy with my ""friend"", i come back to my house the day after with my friend who accompanied me to the entrance, but he didnt do anything apart from that, my mother was crying and took away my phone again and my father went to the house and beaten me in the face, that moment was also the frist time i cut my self with a knife. Ever since that i havent heard from that guy nither the others i was with 

They werent really good people anyway most of them were underemployed and have many problems, the guy i was obsses with basicly had been in a relationship with guys between 16 to 17 while he had 23 at the time plus the asshole had what amouts to a coult following of atleast two other guys one was a 15 year old femboy wich look like a girl and the two fuckers didnt stop remarking how the wanted to fuck eachother to the point of tidium in a group chat we had, and another guy of atleast 19 i think that was a really good person and was hard working too.  We all share a group were we basicly share nudes and porn really wich my mother got acces to thanks to she toking my phone. My ""friend"" didnt do much more than harassing my mother after that really. My stepfather did his own little investigation since he was a cop and is a tremendous fucking asshole, but atleast he has his own problems and good things to even if thats true, but he told me in that moment that because of the people i was with i was going to suffer ""the worst nightmare i ever have"".

After that some time pass and i got into therapy with my mother who pull out off because she didnt wanted to go to a psicologist and i was left alone, i pass though three psicologist atleast wich none of theme help in anything and ended up making the situation wrost because now of what happen i cant basicly lie anymore and that will prohibit me from doing what i wanted 

The only ""good"" thing have manage to do was putting my self in conttact with other trans person who works in whats call ""casa trans"" who i am annoying but i had given her all of my personal info if something happens since i trust her but again i dont do anthing other than constantly annoy her and i think even her had enough off me since i bother her while she is working 

But i have nobody else, i have come to the conclusion that speaking with my mother its not only stupid but only makes things worst and that the only thing it does its hurt her and she had because of me nearly had a heart attack today when we were talking because she thinks i have an obsecion and that ita a ""capricho"" ( i dont know the translation to that sorry) every time i open my mouth to say something it only worsens things, i had told her i was trans and she was fine at the moment i did but when i told her i was going to this place i talk about to inform me she spend the entire day crying 

I dont know anymore what to do i know that despite her disapproval i should continue but its advancing two steps to only be stop in the third

But my mother it not that bad she has brought me things i wanted like depilation cream and had and wanted to protect the few woman clothing i have from my father who wanted to burn it, when i was with this guys she lied to my father to were i was going so i didnt get in trouble

But she also constantly bombard me with messages that were only to insult me and miss treat me wich i responded doing the same to her, she constantly wants to know what i think were i am what i am doing and its drives me crazy because she wants to be in my fucking head all the time to the point of comming in the night when i was sleeping to open my phone wich its not block because of what happen and if i did she only harras me until i gave her the password 

I honesty dont know what to do i need help but i have no one i dont want to lose my family and less my mother but i want to do the things i want to do and be my self and i dont have nowhere to run and theres no end to this missery and i cant take it any more

I learned how to read at 2yo and it went all downhill from there. I never had any friends because they could never understand what i was talking about and my only contact was with adults I was Hyperactive .
I was put on Ritalin at 5 till 13 and started beating my doctor at chess by 7. I was never given any sort of push to accomplish anything or to try and push my limits and was pretty much received no guidance from my parents (mom was my only friend and she treated me like a friend ) At 13 i took myself off the Ritalin because i saw the other kids around me and realized i wasn't like them but by then it was too late...

Started experimenting with weed and booze, made a couple friends and by 15 i had a drinking problem and i still didn't know how to interact with anyone but adults. I also start thinking about suicide. At 16 i started working at a dance club and a record store and had pretty much given up on school. The Club was magical to me, i made 3 friends that i spent all my time with but i knew Hundreds of people. My drinking and drug use became quite profound during this time as i found if i dumb myself down its easier to interact with people in general.

I officially dropped out of school, got my GED and knocked up my Girlfriend.

Married my girlfriend and started working shitty jobs to support my new family. Still drinking at this time but stopped the drug use.

Haven't thought about suicide for a little while.

Really badly damaged my Back and was forced to get a job in a call center. Moods getting worse i figure its just carry over from the whole moody teenage angst thing... I have almost totally quit drinking. I start having severe anxiety attacks and its hard to do anything so i jump from job to job and start looking at treatment options. treatments fail as the doctors have issues diagnosing me also no one can find the right med for me to be on. i have total breakdowns after a couple weeks on each med.

I am becoming more and more withdrawn from society and less tolerant of what i ""believe"" to be stupid people i jump from job to job and never leave the house for things other than work unless the wife makes me. I have Zero interaction with people unless i am forced to. I start actually going to work and have attacks so bad that i call in sick and just sit in the parking lot till my shift is over then go home.

Still not getting any help.

All this goes on for over a decade. i now think about suicide all the time. In 2004 my health after years of neglecting it, takes a turn for the worse. i am put on a new drug for diabetic neuropathy.

Surprise surprise the anxiety attacks and depression start to become controllable.

I keep my job for a year, (longest i ever held a job in my adult life was 6 months) then move to a better job and keep that one for 2 years during this time i end up 100 pounds overweight and have all the issues associated with that. Even on the meds i am still withdrawn and have no social interaction with the outside world except for work. Marriage is dissolving as years of me being screwed up, health issues and meds take their toll, Health and meds make me impotent and i never think about sex. 2008 The wife and i amiably divorce. (I gave her what she wanted no fight) the stress costs me my job. In a 30 day period i loose my family my job and my home and move in with the only friend i have. I start working temp jobs for the remainder of 2008 and my health and moods continue to degrade. 2009 im stuck in the middle the economic breakdown. cannot find a job anywhere. this adds fuel to the fire.

I start mixing Lots of booze and meds. Valum, Lortab, Oxy, Flexeral, ambian and bottles of booze. I now think about dying all the time. the end of 2009 my mother convinces me to move in with her and her new husband (my father had been dead since 97). I do.

There is no alcohol allowed in her house. i get a 6 month contract to work as a supervisor in the census call center starting in january. i am still horribly overweight and thinking about suicide. Mom gets cancer for the 3rd time I get another contract job for the last 6 months of the year. mom is getting worse, my step father starts taking advantage of the fact that im there and treats me like i am his slave. I decide to move and rent a house with a friend, my oldest son and his best friend. Im still thinking about dying all the time but im functioning at work and that's what matters.

In Dec I buy a tv and a tv stand and have a breakdown because i cant put the stand together, I start to realize i have been having memory and thinking issues for years. i cant remember numbers and am unable to work through simple tasks like putting together a bedframe. I start doing some research and find out the med i am on may be to blame. I stop taking it after 6 years. march of 2011 im out of work but my thinking process is coming back. I start a diet. Get my first permanent full time job since 2008. Mom is on Hospice and will die any time. I start making arrangements to pay off the bills i have acquired. I make the calls to set up all the court dates to fix my Suspended license tickets and the driving on no insurance tickets. city court 1, $100.00 fine City court 2, $500 dollar fine County court, $300 dollar fine City court 3, prosecutor is asking for 50 days in jail and 2k in fines for driving on a suspended license and no proof of insurance. i am sentenced in july. I have lost 46 pounds and am having issues doing anything but sitting in my room in the basement i lost my new job because of the possible jail time.

 I spend 95% percent of my awake time in a full blown crippling anxiety attack. I still dont think that well. i feel like my brain is only half there. I WANT to go out and be social. I WANT friends. but on the same hand i want to be totally left alone.
I have a girl i met and i think things could be pretty good between us but im to damn scared to really peruse it.
the next step is writing notes to everyone important (i have been avoiding it) 
Unless people have lived with these feelings they think you are being a drama queen.
IM starting to show signs of simple Agoraphobia. I spent all weekend in my room in the basement with all the lights out. i Spend at least half of every day sitting in complete silence.

Old friend of 25 years died yesterday.

To preface, let me say that I have always had this strange self esteem issue: when I am with friends or family, my self esteem is high. But I truly do hate myself as a human. 
I often go on self hate benders that last all night long. They involve compiling reasons why those I care about should hate my ass and why my death would be a positive thing. The worst part is, I have no reason to be upset. The only reason I hate myself so bad is because of some rather persistent bullies in elementary school whom I don't even remember that well. I guess it is just that I started to believe them and over time it just became part of who I am.  
99% of the time I am fine. I love life, I love everything! But there is this one percent when I hate myself to the point that I think it would be a benefit to end my existence.  
Tonight me and my girlfriend had a long discussion about it. She said that I could be bi-polar. I am currently studying psychology (this is my first year of college) and have no idea weather or not this is true.  
And my girlfriend is the most amazing person in my life, and she says that my self hate is hurting her because she loves me so much, which makes me hate myself more.

My question is do I need professional help? Or do you think I can get by on my own? I am 19 and male if that helps. Thanks in advance.  
I just read the rules before posting so I would like to clarify that I just want to know if you fine people think I need psychiatric help.   

Edit: I forgot to mention something Important. During these self hate benders, I usually beat the ever loving shit out of myself, and blame it on tripping or something stupid.

199940,"Death seems like the best option.I'm 21. My SO left me in october of last year. We had been together for nearly 5 years, including a two year long distance relationship while she went to school. In June of last year, we had a wedding on the beach with our closest friends and family. Despite what happened 4 months later, I still remember it as a beautiful and perfect day.

I can barely barely barely remember the last 6 months. It's all been a blur. I'm trying so hard to move on and to get over her but I can't. I love her so much, even though she's slowly but surely is turnin into a stranger as time and distance does it's work on her. She's found new love and she see's me as a regret that lasted two years too long.

She's probably right. In the place where I was mentally, I wasn't good for her. I caused her a lot of stress and pain because of my own. I was a stupid kid. I feel like I allowed the best thing to ever happen to me collapse around me.

I have few friends, and even fewer close friends. The close friends have grown tired of my misery and I feel completely alone. I'm working towards taking my SAT and GED this summer, but my ADHD and anxiety is causing me a lot of setbacks.

She went to one of the best schools in the country (and the world) for free. I sort of just accepted that I wouldn't go to a school that I would be happy with, but I was content with that because I had the love of my life next to me.

I feel like if I dont do well on these tests, I'll have nothing left. I spend most of my days alone, and when I go out, the people i see and meet do not make me happy. I dream about her every night. I am constantly reminded by our lives together. It's an overwhelming longing that I cannot shake. And it hurts knowing that she's out there. That she chose to remove me from her life.

I feel completely plagued by memory. I feel like my life has turned into a scene from Eternal Sunshine or Inception or Vanilla Sky. I feel trapped within my memories of her. I feel like my world is now broken because she left it. Nothing tastes as good. Nothing makes me laugh as much. And when I cry, no one is there to tell me that I'm their sunshine and they love me soooo much and everything will be okay and that I can do it. It's just me. Just me sobbing into my pillow. And I can't do it. It hurts so much. 

I feel trapped in my existence. I need out. No one will ever love me like she did, and I will never love another like I loved her. I don't think Im capable of loving again.",suicide

I don’t think I want to wait for a potential way with technological and scientific advances. This will definitely sound crazy to some or even many, I believe I’ve experienced a lot of past lives.

The only thing I’m afraid of about death is me being right about my past lives and being put in another life where I’m trans. I feel very disconnected from the world. I should care about my family and friends more. I’ve had too many people in other lives that I’ve loved so much. I don’t know anything for sure.

about myself:

- i'm a 21 year old female

- i guess i'm pretty introverted. i'd love to find a few close friends (even one would be more than enough) to go 'partying' with and get drunk and 'go wild' (when i put it in quatation marks, i mean that although i like the idea of being rowdy and silly like that, i like it for the act itself, not to get attention from other people which is what most people seem to do... i always feel like everyone is surrounded by people but absolutely alone.. and all i want to do is have a few friends.. even one would do that i can occasionally be 'partners' with.. i don't know if that makes sense)

- i'm intelligent but am not knowledgeable about much- mainly attribute this to not being interested in absolutely anything.

- i'm not smart enough for the smart kids but too smart for the dumb ones... by smart i mean i pick up things really quickly.

- i really hope it doesn't seem like i'm full of myself. i don't think i have low self esteem but i'm definitely some sort of depressed.. i'm 21, finishing university dec of this year. have no friends ( kept in touch with a few of my floor mates from first year but i despise them all.. yet i keep in touch because without them i'd actually be completely alone.) i've felt this way (alone with friends that i don't really like or connect with) all my life. i wasn't really aware of it until grade 9. i cry all the time- 2 times a week when i'm good, 2 times a day when it's a bad week. i don't really know why i'm crying, it just feels like an overwhelming amount of pressure (physical pressure on my mind.. like my world is closing in.. but i don't feel anxious or anything like a panic attack, it just feels like if i give up and 'let go' during those moments i'll permanently cross a line into serious depression- i want to stress that i rarely feel anxious or nervous or anything like that)

- i have loving parents who take care of me financially. i live 5 hours away from them and i wish it was more. i love them to death but i began dreaming of what i would do if they died and i was absolutely alone in the world when i was around 7 or 8 years old. i would never ever ever do anything to make this happen and i would feel horrible if anything ever happened to them. these 'day dreams' have also occurred less and less as i grew older since i now technically am no longer 'linked' to them. (sorry for using so many quotation marks.. i have a horrible vocabulary and can't think of the right word to express what i'm trying to say)

- my dad was never home when we were younger which didn't impact me negatively but i now realize that the only real relationship i've ever had was with my mother (since i've never really had any friends and never had any close friends) and she (i love her to death but) loved me more than my sister (twin fraternal sister who never really liked me because my mom never paid attention to her when i was around and always went out of her way to verbally abuse me at school untill a few years ago when we both went to different colleges.. we're 'close' now) and always believed that i would grow up to be some sort of genious because i was really smart when i was younger. 

- i'm attractive and don't really have any self image issues

- i spent my childhood being the mediator between my mom and sister, my mom and my dad, my dad and my sister and my mom and her issues. i was never bitter about it and volunteered to help because i honestly felt that i could help my family but now i wish i could go back and let them all fuck themselves over because i lost out on any form of socializing and am seriously fucking depressed while they're still withering in their shitty lives. eugh. sorry about the sudden change in narrative but as much as i want to look forward and fix this neutrality i'm living in, i can't help but get bursts of rage towards my younger self and how much belief i had in my mother and family's sanity. 


i don't know what else to say. i am utterly indifferent about everything and everyone yet absolutely overwhelmed by loneliness. i want to be with people (or a person) but don' t know who, what i want to do, what i'm interested in.. etc. i want a hobby but i've tried drawing but i get bored, tried going to class but i lose interest because i pick up on the gist of the course really quickly but am too lazy to actually do any of the readings... is everyone like this? my entire life people have told me i'm smart but i'm positive everyone is like this. 


tl;dr: i'm not interested in anything and have tried to find things but seriously don't care about anything. i spend my day sleeping, wasting time on the internet, sometimes exercising, rarely reading, watching stupid shit on the internet, doing the bare minimum to pass my courses.. thats about it.


i've rambled long enough.. i know most people who answer (if any do, which is fine if no one does, there's not really much to say) would likely say things like ""take it one step at a time"" or ""you can get out of this, life is worth living"", which come from a well meaning place but i've tried getting a routine and it does work, in a way. it works at getting you out of the shitty mind set but all it's like i wake up from this dream like state that i'm in and am surrounded by shallow and mentally disturbed people. i'm so sorry if i sound full of myself or like i'm better than most people because i really don't think i am. i just know that the reason why i always go back to this state of nothingness is because when i try to 'live in the real world' i hate it. i hate everyone, i hate the indifference of most people and their neuroses. i'm not nervous all the time. i'm not self conscious all the time. i'm not worried people are talking about me because i don't talk about people behind their back. i try not to lie and i don't cheat or treat people horribly. i get back to people when i say i would and i actually listen when it's 'not my turn to talk'. BUT i'm not so sensitive that i don't understand sarcasm (i'm actually very sarcastic), i'm not uptight and prudish. as i mentioned above, if i ever ended up finding people i actually like (if i ever figure out what it is that i like) i want to 'party' and get drunk and make mistakes and do things i 'regret' and stupid shit. 


i know this is really long and even though i will be checking this religiously for the next while to see if/what anyone posts, i understand if no one says anything that helps because 'knowing that there are others like me' doesn't really help. and i can't trust that i will ever find anyone that i get along with because i'm 21 years old and have yet to meet anyone who is in anyway like me. 


i'm sorry if i didn't represent myself properly. i feel like i sound like a huge bitch but i really hope i'm not. this loneliness is eating me up inside and i really can't take it anymore. this week was just a really bad one so i thought i would post on here instead of wait for this mood to go away again..

I pray to myself every night that I won't wake up but sure enough I do. I've also been completely detached from others. The only time I engage people in conversation is to satisfy my internal desire to mock them and also reassure myself that the humans are beyond redemption. They never disappoint. 

I'll be buying a gun soon so hopefully I'll nut up and do it already. Or maybe not because there's a part of me that enjoys the pain.

200023,"I fucked up. Big time :( So it all started when I finished school and was in the phase of getting into college and joining coaching classes (everyone does in our country, learning something twice so you're more perfect)
Also the college I took admission into was one of those for who didn't score well in school (not me). So basically I was kindof doing them a favor because I had scored good and which meant I would be scoring good further which is good for the clg's reputation. In return, I get to skip basically I give them assurance I will study well on my own. This all just sounds stupid in retrospect but trust me I'm better of not going to the college where they was time teaching literature and EVS and shit which is literally useless.

At the time I was at my aunt's wedding (our families were very close and all) and I was at my native place (basically not where I was supposed to be). Fast-forward, I'm late. When I joined everyone was ahead of me and I was supposed to do some of the beginning chapters on my own. 
Oh and btw I later turned out to have adhd and depression!! 

So because of those reasons I wasn't doing very well on my own. Fast forward to today, I've wasted 1.5 years of time with all of the syllabus due! 
Yea I survived clg without but that doesn't mean I know anything. 
I wasted 10 months doing nothing in covid. 

I'm going to have to drop a year now where I'm going to be alone without any friends and it's going to shitty!  I hate myself and can't get over this!.

Of course, I was smarter than the Doctor so I ignored that diagnosis completely and never went back. Since I was 15 I've kept my core self secret from everyone I've ever known. (I was married at the time, forged documents to get that done...)

My family has a history of schitzophrenia with no less than one person per generation being hospitalized at least as far back as my grandfather. The fear I've been dealing with for the past 10 or so years is that I'm NOT bi-polar but more in line with schitzophrenia. 

When I'm not self medicating (and I'm not now) I'm VERY paranoid. The further from 'treatment' the worse the symptoms get, but then I've never gone longer than 6 months without dosing since I was 24.... I'm certain that friends and family members are plotting against me and lose trust in EVERYONE. As in, no joke, even people that on some level I know are trying to help me just piss me off. (How fucking DARE they think THEY can help ME?!) The time I went 6 months without, I lost every friend I had in the city I live in, and I know it's coming again now...

I'm 4 days out from when I ended my self treatment. The local 'Mental Health' office won't even schedule an appointment until next week, I honestly don't think I'll be able to be honest with anyone by the time they get around to seeing me. 

What do I do? Go back to to my self treatment? I can manage like that and in fact it works pretty well when I can maintain my dose, but I haven't even eaten in 2 days (strike that, some raisins, 2 cans of diet soda and I've now got 4 beers and some popcorn) so buying anything else to help is also out of the question. (I have 81 cents on a debit card.)

Earlier today I was ready to beat a guy. A small amount of anger might have been justified, but I verbally tore him to shreds and was forcibly ejected under threat of law enforcement. I knew I should shutup, but I just fucking couldn't. My history tells me this will escalate over the next few days until I am unable to function in public.

200038,"I don't know if I'm depressed, having an existential crisis, or just ....I apologize in advance for the wall of text and maybe the incoherence of the text.

I don't exactly know how to start this. It's been almost a year since my younger brother committed suicide which accidentally lead to the death of my father. I always knew he was often sad, maybe depressed but since going to college, I didn't contact him much so the event was a shot in the gut.

I am currently a junior in college at a ""top tier"" university. Throughout high school, I struggled with depression inwardly. I never had any close friends/still don't. I have friends who are generally all very positive, intelligent and for the most part happy with life. 

Regardless of the university, I'm currently struggling to get an internship for the summer (which contributes significantly to this I believe?). The friends I've mentioned have all secured their internships with some extremely prestigious companies. (I honestly don't know if/why they associate with me.)

I mentioned that I've struggled with depression for a long time. I always attributed to my lack of a significant other/lack of career opportunities. In high school, the former led me to thoughts of suicide but I managed to overcome it by almost suppressing the urge. In college, the urge remained dormant until this year, the trigger being my friends getting SO's and internships. 

After hearing what happened, I honestly just suppressed the emotions because I knew I couldn't handle facing it mentally. (I still don't think I've truly opened up that Pandora's Box.) 

I'm sad that I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm sad that I can't hug anyone when I feel like dying. I'm sad that I'm an idiot who can't get an internship. I'm sad that I've wasted these years of college being depressed and antisocial. I'm sad every time I see a couple. I'm sad every time I get a rejection letter. 

In front of others, I always maintain some semblance of  happiness. Though I think some of my friends know of the tragedies, I have not talked to anyone about it. 

I don't know what to do anymore. If I don't get an internship for the summer, I'm fucked. I already wasted my college years so I'm fucked socially. As a person, I'm probably extremely generic and mundane to talk to. I just don't know why I exist as a person anymore. ",suicide

Chapman traveled westward planting small nurseries of apple trees, which he left in the care of the locals. 

2. **In the 1970’s, geographer C. Etzel Pearcy proposed revising the U.S. map from 50 to 38 states.** He claimed the reduced number of states would reduce government spending. 

3. Even though the Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776, making it our “independence day”, **John Adams said he believed Independence Day should’ve been July 2, since that was the day the Continental Congress voted for independence.**

4. **The Philadelphia Zoo, America’s first zoo, opened in July of 1874.** The admission was 25 cents for adults and 10 cents for children. 3,000 visitors saw 813 animals opening day.

5. **Meat packer Samuel Wilson was the inspiration for Uncle Sam.** During the War of 1812, Wilson supplied the army with barrels of beef.

6. **The myth that the Liberty Bell was cracked during celebrations on July 4, 1776 is, well, a myth.** The bell actually first cracked in c. 1752 due to its poor quality. Many attempts have been made to fix the bell, but the fixes never lasted. The current crack the bell bears happened in the 19th century.

7. **33rd President Harry Truman’s middle name was just “S”.** His parents were unable to decide which of his two grandfathers they wanted to honor: Solomon Young or Anderson Shipp Truman. They compromised by using S, standing for Solomon and Shipp.

8. During World War II, the Navajo language was used as a code by the U.S. Marine Corps. The code was unbreakable due to the Native American language’s complex grammar and the fact it had no written alphabet.

My doctor broke patient confidentiality and told my mom (I'm 17 btw) about my suicidal thoughts and made her take away this knife I had in my room. We made an appointment with the mental health place.
So we go and I get an assessment done at this place and that's when it gets so so so much worse. The counselor there went even further and told my mom about my self-harm. I've been self-harming for years but I never thought my family would find out about it. It hit me like a truck and I know they look at me differently now. My mom even cried on the entire ride home. So anyway, they want me to do this program but of course, this is America after all and so its very very expensive. My mom says that if i want to do it, i need to take the money out of my college fund. It would take over half of my funds and i'd only have about $6,000 left over for college. 
I really do want to do this program, as i've already emailed my summer activity teacher and canceled that, which made me sad since it's my senior year and i've been in this activity for all of high school so far. Too late to take that back now though. I wish my mom had told me about the college funds before she let me quit that. 
So now i have to decide between getting treatment or keeping my college fund. The deciding factor really is whether I think i can keep myself safe over summer, but the thing is, i really don't know. This whole thing, my family finding out everything...I honestly have nothing to lose anymore. I want to major in zoology and work with animals in college and as a career, but i just don't know if going through everything is worth it. What if I just end up killing myself anyway, even after it all? If i did treatment i'd be in debt for the rest of my life, more than I already would be by keeping all my funds. I dont know why my mom wont help me look into other options, its like she doesnt want me to get help. It is truly all about money to her. I'm sure theres other programs that would work out better. My family is basically broke so i get where she's coming from but shes not even trying to find other options. Maybe if i just try to kill myself i'll get a forced hospitalization, then someone will have to pay anyway. The whole thing is just making me more suicidal! I don't have anything to live for anymore. I might as well spend my college funds since ill probably be dead by the time college rolls around anyway. Idk. I'm just looking for some advice since this is a really hard situation to be in.

I have been doing okay in school until now. I’m a complete failure. My parents were never content with all of my B’s and high C’s, so I just gave up completely. I never felt a sense of accomplishment with them. I never felt like I have genuinely made my parents proud. Sure they will tell me I make them proud everyday, but the world knows it doesn’t come from the bottom of their hearts.

First of all I'd like to apologize for what I did, I know you would have helped had you known but I felt to ashamed to talk to anyone about it. Sorry for doing it on my birthday too, but I just couldn't wait any longer. Besides, even if I wanted to the anxiety would just make me stutter non stop like it always does. You called it my dads curse because it runs in his side of the family, but the word curse doesn't do it justice. Imagine being unable to speak to someone at an articulate level, to be looked down on in every single conversation you have, to have girls laugh when you try to talk to them, to have your friends make fun of you everyday for something that isn't your fault. I couldn't even get help if I wanted to, the words just physically wouldn't come out.

It's not your fault, you didn't fail as a mother. I failed as a person because I got used to killing myself slowly and just accepted it. Please don't spend money on a funeral service or anything, put it towards Joe's college fund or something. 

But before this ends you have to know something. When I was younger dad would frequently molest Joe and I after showering. Back then I didn't think much of it, because why would my own dad hurt me. I don't think Joe remembers, but I do. I just thought you should know. It's up to you what you do, I know you love him with all your heart and would be crushed to hear this, but I had to say it before I left.

To any of the people I used to consider friends, its not your fault either. I pushed you away and it's my fault, I should have brought you closer but instead I just ran in shame. Sorry about leaving, I know a few of you might be upset but at least I can stop feeling now. Keep doing what you guys are doing and try to be successful. The only thing I'm going ask is to get closer as friends, really try to be there for each other. You might not know it but a lot of the people that put up that strong front are really hurting inside and could use some friends to keep their spirits up. 

Please don't get too upset, I know it's going to be tough but I'm confident you guys can get through this. I'm going to miss you guys, stay strong.

My grades are currently going even farther to shit, and I am failing at least one class.  I don't know exactly, because I am afraid to check my grades.  I have severe depression and anxiety and have sought help for it, and my parents have been mostly supportive, but all too often make me feel even more worthless.  They won't even trust me to keep my medication in my room, as they are afraid i'll kill myself.  I can just as easily get the bottle of medication from the cabinet, but just the fact that they don't even trust me makes me feel like shit.  I have no self confidence, and never really have.  I don't even really have any real friends, they just treat me like a second-rate person, like a backup for hanging out at school.  I used to be on varsity swim and play water polo, but have been forced to quit both teams.  I was sexually assaulted over the summer during a practice by another player, and upon telling the coach, I was forced to leave the team.  I can't even do swim because the same people who assaulted me on water polo are on swim as well.  I tried to join track, but ended up quitting after one practice of absolute hell.  I used to be able to do well during the ""hell week"" practices and such, but now I don't have the motivation nor the mental capacity to deal with both sports and homework at the same time.  My psychiatrist refuses to give me any dose of medication that will do anything to help, keeping me on pitifully small doses under 30mg most of the time.  To put this in perspective, I weigh 160lbs.  I've also been going to counseling, but the counselor never really gives me anything to help, she just sits there and talks about the first issue I bring up for the entire hour.  I'm also turning into a fatass, since i'm not doing any sports, and I can feel myself just wasting away in front of my computer.  I hate life.  I don't know what to do anymore, and everything just seems hopeless.  I can barely drag myself out of bed each morning, even though I've always been a morning person and love getting up early.  My parents don't want me to tell the counselor or doctor about my thoughts of suicide, because it will then be out of our control and i'll be placed into a hospital, but the more I go to the doctor the more I have to lie about how i'm feeling to get rid of suspicion of that.

Update (~6:00p Pacific) Just got home from the doctors. He told me that was I was experiencing was probably something deeper than common depression. (I think Bipolar. My dad has it. And there's a 50% chance of a child getting it when one parent has it.) He prescribed me Lamictal and gave me the number of a specialist who can tell me for sure what my problem is.

200113,"the light has left mehello,

 i am a guy in my early twenties, although i have a history with anxiety and depression it has never been this bad before.

here comes the basis for all this shit, sorry if this is long.. 

i was violently abused by my mother for most of the time my parents were together and my father was away with the army a lot.
when we were living in chester my dad would be away a lot more and my mother worked at a school cleaning, so there was often long periods where me and my brother and sister were alone in the house... i really dont know how to lead to this so i'll just say it; my older brother(he was 14, i was 9 and my sister was 6) raped both me and her on the same day within less than two hours of eachother as the other was in the room, its something ive never told a soul. i harbour an intense hatred for my brother it blinds me. id mentally blocked this memory for well over 10years until recently.

when i was 14 my mother kicked me out of home and made my dad take me in, he wasnt used to caring for anyone and the responsiblity of me seemingly drove him to the bottle which he'd drink every night and the odd night he'd wander up to my room drag me from the bed when i was sleeping and batter me all over, this got a whole lot worse when he discovered i was gay(u would never kno normally but he went trawling through my internet history when i was out).

after about 2years he kicked me out onto the streets and i was left homeless with nowhere to go, i ended up being in a string of homeless hostels from 17 onwards. i was a pushover the first home i got from the council was muscled in on by 2 heroin dealers that i knew as they were the parents of a girl i met in the hostel, they drove me out, i ran away, stole a large some of money from a man who took me in and fled.
i was taken in by a dear friend who gave me his bed and the whole time i stayed there he slept on his sofa. i didnt realise but i loved him so much.

when i moved on from his house i got my own room in a shared house with friends, he had stayed round for my birthday and set off to ride home, i remember saying goodbye n then 2 days later i was told he had been killed. literally straight from my house to his, he was almost home n he got hit by a car and killed.
i never dealt with grief properly and i became homeless again.

i had made a friend(*) who i cared deeply for, he stayed with me all the time, sofa-surfing with me nd always makin sure that we had somewhere to go, i loved him so much and i still do, i really badly still want to be with him. it kills me now coz i really need him to be there for me again but he is so distant now.. 
everytime we talk i feel i am forcing it from him and i end up goin psycho at him coz i just really need him..
anyway things were lookin up for me; i had got a house, got a job, i was happy all of the time, i had a cat &amp; i had a friend living with me.

the suddenly all in the space of a week my friend moved out, took the cat, i lost my job and got an eviction letter aswell as being in a lot of debt.

now all of these horrible fuckin memories just keep film-reeling through my head and they wont stop for anything.
almost everyday i am breaking down into a fit of tears the quickly esculates into blind rage and i end up smashing everything up before i can tell myself not to.
there is a hollow in my chest that just keeps getting heavier.

i dont indulge suicidal thoughts, if i catch myself doing it i will stop it, but... now im getting these urges... i live on the 3rd floor of a highrise and im frequently feeling an overwhelming desire to jump from the window. i also have set of swords that are incredibly sharp, ive never properly self harmed before(selfmedicated with illegal drugs and i used to hit myself over the head to get a numb feeling) but again i am getting visual flashes and that incredible urge to drag the blade across my throat but with empashis on a weighted drag..
i cant play music anymore, nothing comes out, its soulless, my art is the same, i have nothing to bury myself in to make it go away.

it all culminated in a eipsode of rage and tears in front of people i know and my friend(*) who was with me through the homelessness,
now i am just drowning in shame aswell as everything else, i cant imagine what he thinks of me now...
i am usually the first to be optimistic and look to the light but it has finally forsaken me. there isnt anything left in me that has the power to switch it back on. i cant sleep coz the memories flyby incessantly, i have to stay awake for as long as possible so that i am forced to sleep from exhaustion,
everything is suffering, i can no longer speak properly, i have increased psychomotor aggitation, can't read or write as well as i used to and when i see myself, all i see is shambling waste of breath ready to become a corpse.

i dont want to die but i cant take this anymore.

its too much now, i need to wipe it all clean, i need it all to leave my mind forever, wash it away, i feel corrupted from the moment i wake i despise myself and my life.
ive always been told u should never blame others for ur own shortcomings, all i have been doing is blaming myself, finding reasons to explain why people have done these things to me, why i must have deserved it in some way.

the most pathetic part ofi t all is; i miss the goddamn cat so much everytime i thnk about her i burst into tears.

i dont know what to do, nobody will take me seriously because i keep lashing out aggressively. ive become something nobody would want to save..

i dont know what i expect from posting this but it cant make things any worse i guess

thanks for ur time, i really appreciate it

200117,"Don't ask me how I know.I know the real purpose of life.

Take a few seconds to think about LIFE, the planet Earth, the rest of the Universe, and the other Universes.

Think of mothers and fathers, people and societies, wars and depressions, situations where survival was impossible and people perished. What would be the purpose of all of this pain, death, degradation, warfare, and horror? The purpose is... wait there's some more.

Why does LIFE bring about everything it does?

*LIFE is engaged in the constant struggle with DEATH* Life is, in a way, war.
The molecules, the cells that are within us, are within a realm of information called a person. The people of Earth, are all within a realm of information called humans.  All of the life in the Universe, is connected within a realm of information called LIFE.

The essence of you is not physical, it is energetic/informational. You are not real, not in the sense that you think.  You are a piece of LIFE code, a set of instructions of how to guide DEAD matter, in a way that LIFE itself does not perish all across the Universe. This is evolution. This is the survival of LIFE. You are the soldier of life, and your only weapon and armour is your SOUL. The only one you will ever get, and one that will exist for as long as LIFE exists, somewhere.
There is life and there is physical matter. You are an edge in between. And right now, on this planet, the physical matter, death, and the laws of nature are winning the battle with LIFE (human life at least). What all of you are feeling are the manifestation of this impending ultimate loss. There is no happiness to be gained on Earth, because we are all in the losing throngs of the one last battle.

The laws of physics are harsh. For your body to stay alive, it needs a constant supply of energy, energy that has to be EARNED, obtained, and is not given out otherwise. Human society is a huge inefficient energy hog and there might not be enough time for all of us to learn to share. Humans have a pre-programmed competitive spirit, where we starve other people to survive ourselves. This is our code. We may never evolve past it, but some life will.

The purpose of life is to develop your code, to hone it - till it's sharp and robust and geared for LIFE, so that once you die and went back into the realm of information, the non-physical energy field of possibilities, and once had your rest and found out all of the secrets of life, you can get back on the battlefield, back towards the edge, who knows where, using your old code, your karma if you will, to try once more to advance the cause of life, which is existence. 

If your mind is working against you, and the matter in your body wants to decay, take control. Give your body and mind some nutrition, rest and rewards, release yourself from this Earth mentality, and continue plugging away at the old code. You will be reborn, in a more advanced society, if your code can function there without becoming damaging to the society. 

I know mine isn't up to snuff yet... too  human.

I’m a 13 year old female artist (I use that term loosely) I hate school to the point of wanting to literally bang my head as hard as possible into a locker and hope to all hell that I die if I just keep hitting it. But obviously I didn’t do that nor will I most likely, I have been depressed probably since I was about 8 or younger and I have always thought of suicide and I don’t really know why. I probably having things mentally wrong with me but I have gotten extremely good at hiding my depression and suicidal thoughts for over 5 years now, and I only keep getting better. I have broken down in school recently because of extreme anxiety around people and especially when someone takes my things (someone I called a friend stole my bag and thought of it as a joke which this only made everything worse) I don’t know why I can get extreme anxiety from this but I do. I have never really had a want to live to be completely honest. Until a few days ago, so this is where I’m like “what the fuck is wrong with me?” Because I met someone on a game they were nice and it was just enjoyable to be with them we ended up playing later that day and overall spent 9 hours together that day. But he was in a bad relationship (long distance) and when I heard him literally crying in the voice chat I was so extremely worried and scared I didn’t know what to do so I stayed with him for at least an hour trying to make sure he was ok. He was nice and never wanted me to be upset and I didn’t want that for him either and we both ended up having a crush on each other. For a little I was happy but that didnt last. It all went away so fast I didn’t even get a chance to hold onto it. Because when the weekend started I started to feel depressed and later into the night when I was going to bed (yesterday) I started to think of suicide. Now today I’m acting like I’m ok and for a little while I was with him I truly was ok, he keeps me calm and I can’t deny that. But I still think of cutting myself hurting myself doing anything to harm myself and for the past few months I’ve been on the edge of cutting myself etc. and I’m just here thinking “what’s wrong with me?” “Why am I shaking so much and crying?” “Why does he like me? I’m just a freak” I have these thoughts so so much and I can’t help it, it’s becoming harder to hide this, mainly from him and its kind of driving me mad because I don’t want to bother him I just want him to be happy.

200126,"I stopped being afraid of suicide a long time ago. Is this a bad thing?Hey there,

I've struggled on and off with suicidal thoughts in the past, but the past few months have been pretty rough and they've gotten to the point where last Friday I was basically going to overdose on painkillers before I realised I didn't have enough. That near-attempt and my thoughts the past few days have led me to realise that I'm not really scared of committing suicide anymore. There's no fear, or any strong emotions at all actually, when I think about not being alive anymore. 

And because I realised I didn't feel anything much about it, I've been provoking myself in small ways, hoping to get a reaction: pressing a knife against my chest, standing too close to the edge of a train platform and thinking about how easy it would be to step off, etc., but it never makes me feel anything. 

I've made a plan to kill myself but I don't know if I would actually follow through with it - my emotions and my feelings about suicide are now so numb that most days it's a case of ""okay, I *could* kill myself today, or I could watch TV."" Or, ""I *could* jump in front of this train, or I could go see a movie later."" 

I feel like this is a bad thing, but it'd be interesting to have other people's opinions on it.",suicide

I've always been an independent person, because my classmates treated me that way. I have schizoid personality disorder, as a result of being an outcast and having to adapt to being one.

I've never been social either. Middle school was the time I dropped off into antisocial behavior.

My only true friend has left the school and now I'm left with borderline autistic 14 year olds.

The big dick mcgees always make fun of me for their extra brownie points, and very few kids think I'm alright because I'm not doing anything.

Half the school day is thinking about suicide from the amount of work that has been put on me. The work usually consists of 3 hours+ homework a night, but I've been a procrastinator all my life and the think of the work gives me a migrane. It's bleeding into my private life, and the last thing I want is for it to bleed into my private life.

200156,"My mum attempted suicideI guess I'm making this thread to look for advice on how to support someone with depression. About a month ago, my mum tried to take her life by overdosing on anti-depressants or mood stabilisers or something. When my dad noticed that she wasn't waking up from her nap, she was rushed to hospital and stayed in a mental health ward for a couple of weeks. Now she's back at home (I go to university in a nearby city) and doing some sort of daily programme at the hospital, but I'm constantly worrying that it's going to happen again.

My family isn't very good at being open about our feelings. It came as a shock to me when I first heard about it. I knew that my mum was struggling emotionally, but I had absolutely no clue that it had gone so far. Part of that was her own doing. She wasn't telling her therapist the truth about how she felt. She was bottling things up and putting up a facade of normality whenever I came to visit. I made it clear when I first visited her in hospital that I wanted her to be open with us and with her psychiatrist; that all I wanted was to see her get better and pretending things were normal didn't make me or her feel the slightest bit better. I also made sure that my dad was much more involved in the recovery process: getting an emergency phone, talking regularly with the psychiatrist, etc (although I think the hospital was going to arrange that anyway). I've also been going home more often and taking walks with her. On the walks she often talks about how things are going with her recovery, but there's definitely a wall up beyond which she won't go. 

I see us falling back into the same habits a little bit (of pretending things are okay), and I'm so worried that she's telling me her recovery is going well when it really isn't. Has anyone else been in a situation like this? What are the best things I can do to support her?

You know, i have these voices in my head, talking to me 24/7, i'm going trough a very hard time for almost a year now, me and my 'girlfriend' broke up, exactly 6 january 2017.

She has no clue, but i've tried killing myself 3 weeks after that, when she was dating a friend of mine, just 5 days after we broke up she started dating him.

I knew she'd miss me, because i litterly did everything for her, there's not a guy that will ever be able to compeed to that.
Eventuelly, after 9 months (around october), i started feeling better again. Went studying got good grades, got lifegoals, i knew she missed me, but when she actually tried to come back, i couldn't.. I couldn't just say no, now we're trying to solve our shit out but it's not working for me, i can't forget that she slept with him, just 2 weeks after a 2.5 year relationship, she fucked someone else. She made her parents (who loved me very much, they liked me alot) hate me. We can't even be togheter anymore because of all the lies that have been told, her mom doesn't allow it &amp; even if she did, i'm not sure if i can forget her fucking that guy, she even kissed someone at a party, in front of my nose one week before she started talking to me again just to hurt me because she was ""jelly"" because some girls where talking to me... she's always had her eyes on me whenever we meet at parties...

I do believe she misses me and wants me back, but why all the lies? why go and fuck someone else, how can you say you love me if you're capable of doing that after a 2.5 year relationship?

I feel calm, that calmness scares me, cause i'm really close to killing myself &amp; i think that's what i want, however i don't want to hurt my family.

Sometimes i kinda just think like, i wanne fake my death &amp; see how it turns out &amp; come back if people change, if her mom sees what damage she's causing, if she see's what damage she caused...

I am trying. I have been trying. I am tired of trying. I’m not going to get into any specifics, but it seems as if everything in my life is crumbling down and I just can’t handle everything anymore. I don’t think I have friends. Sure I have those people I see in school, but I don’t hang out with much people outside. I don’t have people who check up on me. I don’t have anyone who messages me first. That sounds so entitled. But I do try to be the person for other people  I want to be able to confide to to a couple of people. Every time, someone shows an interest in me.. I just feel so insecure about myself and push them away. I don’t want anyone else to deal with my insecurities.. especially cause I’m a guy. It’s like that cliché quote you see around on Twitter, “you can’t love anyone else before you love yourself.” I used to think that was bullshit but now, I can’t think of anything that fits me the most.

Everyone always tells me that I should stop being sad because I’m lucky to have this and that, and I am so tired of people invalidating my feelings. No one sees what goes on inside my head. No one sees the personal battles I constantly face. It’s so hard to confide in people without feeling them judging you.

200194,"Nearing my limitI've been depressed for 4 years now. All started when my best friend moved away before 7th grade started- he was the only real friend I've ever had. I got bullied a lot in elementary school, no one spoke to me in middle school- but he was always there for me, always able to make me laugh. We still keep in touch, but it's definitely not the same as it was back then. I was completely alone all throughout 8th and 9th grade, now I truly know what it means to have no friends. I literally did not have a single friend- I spoke to no one. I managed to finally find a friend who seemed like a very nice person at the start of this school year, (I'll call him Jon) but he left the school in the 2nd quarter and we don't talk much anymore. Now, this year, I met the two people that have fucked up my emotions more than anyone ever has. It started off that I became friends with (for anonymity's sake, I'll call them Joe and Anne, even though this is a throwaway account) Joe, through helping him out with a computer issue he had. We then started playing video games, and he invited Anne to join us (she's also a gamer). Now I had a bit of a crush on Anne towards the end of last year and still did this year, but that doesn't come into play until later. So those two, me, and Jon (he was still attending the school at this time) would play games every day after school, and things were pretty good. I finally had some friends after going so long without anyone, my depression was finally feeling like it would fade away. Around a month later, Jon stops talking to or having any contact with Joe and Anne. This confused them both, so I went ahead and asked Jon what was up with that. He told me that he thought Joe was a bad influence, and that he didn't want to have anything to do with him or Anne as she was his best friend. I really, really wish I listened to him. Maybe then, I wouldn't feel quite as terrible as I do now typing this. Over time, I began to understand what he meant. After every conversation with Joe, no matter how trivial, I always felt a little worse than before I began talking with him. I failed to mention this before, but Joe also liked Anne. And this is the start of how I grew to dislike Joe more and more, not out of jealousy, but because he failed to tell me from the start that Anne liked him as well. They were both planning on dating Junior year so that they wouldn't need to worry about having parents drive them places, as they'd have their licenses by then. As I grew closer to Joe and Anne, my feelings for Anne grew as well- so upon hearing this I suppose you could say I was a little disappointed... But, as I am and always will be loyal to those I call friends, I was not jealous of him but instead happy for him. I did all I could to try and resolve the little fights that they'd get into from time to time, and it worked most of the time. Joe would come to me for advice, and I'd do my best to provide it, and most of the time my advice worked. But, around Christmas time this year, Anne did the exact same thing that Jon (Jon had left the school by then) did, but on a much more extreme level. She full on avoided him, never saying a word to him, not even making eye contact. This confused him as much as it confused me, but he told me that she started to become more distant with him as she got back in contact with her friends from (do not want to disclose personal info, even with fake names- will use filler state) Wisconsin. She apparently had an ex boyfriend there that she claimed she no longer had feelings for anymore, but she started to text him and call him much more often recently. I told him to give her some space, and that he shouldn't have anything to worry about because she didn't seem like the type to hold on to a long distance relationship. She wound up never speaking to him again. Joe, also began to speak to me less and less, and again, I was hit with the familiar loneliness that was lingering waiting for its chance to come back into my mind. Around a 3 weeks later, Anne started talking to me more. We began to talk more and more, I was happy that I finally had someone to talk to and my depression was easing its foot off of my neck. The more I talked to her, the more I liked her. Eventually, I started thinking ""Hey. She's single, I like her, I get the feeling that she likes me, why not ask her out?"" And so I did. She was the first person I've ever asked out. She responded saying that she wasn't going to date anymore until she turned 16 the following month, but she also said ""But, don't take this as a no, if you are still interested try asking again next month.""...... if only she just said no. Why didn't she just fucking say no... So, I decided that I would take her advice. We still talked just as much if not more after that, but this time around she was quite a bit more flirty with me. Of course, this didn't bother me. I could deal with occasional hugs from a girl I had a crush on, who wouldn't? Soon enough however, she started to talk with her friends from Wisconsin more often, but she introduced them to me (albeit, it was only over a voice chat software) and they actually seemed like really cool people. I didn't get to talk to her ex though. Around a week later, she found out that one of her closer friend's boyfriend was being abusive. He would hit her, and threaten to kill himself if she broke up with him. He even put a gun to his head at one point. Hearing about this pissed me off to the core. I legit wanted to go down there and beat him to death. Abuse is one thing that truly infuriates me. A week later though, Sara's (filler name for Wisconsin friend) father managed to get a restraining order on the sicko after learning about what was happening, but understandably she was still an emotional mess. So Anne decided that she would go to Wisconsin over the first weekend of Spring Break to help Sara cope with it and ""give support"". Yea, right. So she kept going on and on about how it wasn't supposed to be a fun trip, and that she was just going in order to help her friend, and I believed her. Honestly, it didn't bother me at all- the visiting thing, of coarse the situation itself made me sick. But as the weeks went by, she spoke to me less and less- I had no idea why. But once spring break came, the first night that she got there, and just one week before her birthday, she posted a video on her snapchat story of her and her ex making out and smoking. This. This made me mad, very mad. Jealous? No. Mad. Mad because she lied to me, and mad because I thought that I could trust her. Mad because she never told me no. I went on that whole time, thinking that her and I could eventually be more than friends, but now just seeing her makes me angry. Adding that to the depression I already have to deal with, and the extremely low self esteem that I already have- seeing that made me feel worthless. This is just some of the shit I've had to deal with this year, and I'm not even getting to the things I need to deal with at home. I would type more but as the title says, I'm nearing my limit. I just wish that my friends would stop leaving me, and I wish that I could have been the person that Anne wanted to be with. I don't know where I went wrong. At this point, I just feel lost and confused and I have no one to talk to or to vent to. All of this is like a megaton of weight being pressed on me at all sides, with constant headaches as icing on the cake. I'm sorry for writing so much, but I just felt like I had to get this off of my chest. If things don't get better soon, I honestly do think I will kill myself. There is nothing in this life that I would go through this pain again for in order to get, and just when I thought things couldn't get worse- just when my only friend left me- the only friend I had that never once betrayed me, and managed to keep me in a good mood at all times, the brother I never had. Things got worse. And so far, my life has not been a rollercoaster of ups and downs. It's been a constant decline down the side of a mountain, with tiny bumps that can be viewed as times I think things will be getting better only to begin falling once again. Well I've fallen for the last time. In all honesty, I don't want to die. But I can't see the worth in going through a life that will not impact anyone, just to lose everything I never had. Thank you for reading this if you did, I suppose I can do my best to hold off any suicidal tendencies I may have but I don't intend to make any promises that I can't keep. I'm sorry. ",suicide

200204,"At this point killing myself just feels harder than coasting along aliveI half-assed tried to hang myself almost three weeks ago the day my ex broke up with me but my body just kept panicking to keep itself alive so I didn't succeed. Since then I've just been coasting as I have been the last 4 years.

 After transferring to my current college I had my first relationship at 19 but it was never defined so I never knew what we were so when it ended out of the blue I was shaken to my core. From then I've had no friends, the friends I have from high school have kinda drifted from me even though we're all still living in the same area, we just don't hang out often or talk to each other. I went through two sets of roommates who made my life hell so I've been living in a studio after the last set because my anxiety about living with other people became so bad I couldn't do it again. 

Then there was another relationship where my ex was emotionally abusive by being emotionally abusive through the way of always letting me know he had the potential of being physically violent, but never actually doing anything to me, so I was scared to leave for at least 2 months. Shortly after that, I ended up in the relationship that just ended. I seriously thought he was the love of my life, but I guess he was unhappy and ended up breaking my heart right after our one year anniversary. During that whole year of my relationship, I had to delay my graduation plans because I got sick with Mono and was out for a month. Right as I was getting back to my life, my best friend killed herself and this month on the 20th is the one year anniversary of that. Right now I have two Ds and have had the hardest time getting myself to my classes so who knows if I'll even be able to graduate this spring. 

I've been depressed since I was 13 and have just felt like I've been coasting through my life to this point. There's a lot of changes happening at once and I want nothing to do with them. I have no job or internship prospects for after school, but I still have my retail job and while I enjoy it, I can't live on this or do it forever. I'm so tired and feel so worthless that I just want to cease existing. But getting my body to the point where it will just let go seems like more work than just putting in enough effort to get by. I cried the entire way home from work last night and I'm at my parents' house tonight because I went to see my younger brother's high school band concert so I'm spending the night. I spent the part of the day here watching my mom freak out about bills and I'm just like ""I don't want this. I don't want any of it."" I feel like I've seen enough and none of it seems worth it, but god damn is killing yourself hard work.",suicide

I’m just struggling a lot with some past traumatic things I experienced last year and can’t seem to outrun them, or to really outrun anything honestly. 

I’m depressed, I’ve gained so much weight the past few months, I’m not adapting to anything well, I cringe endlessly at everything I do and say because I’m so grossed out at myself and who I am, and I’m just fucking tired of being here. 

I have a constant dialogue running in my head that says “you could just kill yourself,” or “you won’t be here long enough for ____ to matter.” It can be as simple as fucking up a gift I’m wrapping. 

The really overwhelming thing is that I can’t shake the thought that dying would mean people would finally believe everything I’ve needed them to believe. Mainly about the traumatic event that seemed to be a joke to the police, like I relish the mental image I have of writing a letter to them and mailing it before I die so they know what they did and what others did ruined a person. 

But even just in a larger sense, everyone would realize I was always struggling and this isn’t just some phase or something I want for myself. I want out of the pain but I don’t feel ready.

But it's so hard. And I have no one....no one in my life to talk to. Just me and the roar of my worn out laptop's fan that has lived far longer than it should have.....just like me

What I mean is that I don't think anything particularly bad has happened in my life and on the surface, I should be happy, very happy in fact...but I'm not.

I come from a fairly average family, not rich by any stretch but not poor either, and I don't have much trouble finding work, although it tends to be part-time hours, rather than a steady job (I'm 18, by the way.)

Anyway, the reason for my feeling this way is that I'm lonely, horrendously lonely, I have plenty of friends and a family that are always there but I still feel alone. There's nobody that I can spend a lot of time with and I have very little chance of finding a girlfriend because of my looks, or lack thereof.

To complement this, I've completely ruined any (good) job prospects that I might have. I left college/high school where I was doing okay, studying law with a view to going to university, this is no longer an option. Due to health reasons I'm also unable to join the military, which has been my dream job since I was young, I'm now stuck moving between dead end jobs where I'll earn minimum wage, whereas since I was a kid I've been expected to aim high in terms of a career.

The way I see it, I have no reason to keep on living, it's hard to explain and I haven't done it properly, Anyway...thank you for reading this, I'm glad that somebody cares enough even to read my post, though it's likely to be my final one, I've finally decided that I want to die. The only thing that's been stopping me for the last year is that my family will be devastated, but that's starting to bother me less and less, I really want to die.

I decided that since this is my future and I really like my studies that I had to skip work to focus on learning and that I still have like $30k in cash in my bank account.

I was so embarrassed that I couldn't keep up with my job and my university that I didn't even call them, I just didn't showed up to my shift. Of course this week I called them, explained it and they told me to come to file my resignation letter. It was really a cool job with a lot of nice girls and boys in my age and I really regret my decision.

At the same time last week my two female roommates decided that they want to leave our commune, we are a total of 4. The two girls and another guy. A friend of them told me, and I couldn't believe it. When I wrote them a message they just played it down that they only think about it, and aren't sure.

Backstory in short: had a house, furniture, a good job and a gf. In the end she left me and because i'm a little simple I never checked the paperwork and I'm left with nothing but my two cats and a fridge/freezer/computer/some furniture. I have around 8k € in debt from the house renovations that I have to pay.  
Lost my job and now I've used up my cc debt to buy food for me and the cats. I live at my ex-step fathers place (no father, and my mother is an abusive bitch who doesnt want anything to do with me, she also left this guy), he was kind enough to take me in for a while but I cant stay. I couldnt pay for my car insurance/technical control so I cannt drive it anymore. I live in the middle of nowhere now and I cant get to anything on foot. My mind has been driving me crazy lately and i keep getting these thoughts that scare me, scare me of myself.  
At night i cant sleep ever, Im just awake until i collapse. I tried contacting all the places that offer help, but because i'm not a woman or child I'm number 12000-something in line to get help. I can't manage another week and i cant talk to people... I just shut down when i try, ive tried sending letters to instances, doctors, organisations but most of them dont even reply. I call them but I cant make any words come out when they answer. I guess in a few more days my internet and phone will be shut down.  
It feels as if there is no way out anymore and im so scared. I cant even cry anymore at this point and my chest hurts.

I’ve only gone to a therapist two times and the visits were about a year apart. The only reason my parents even took me in the first place is becaue they found out completely against my will that I was drinking and self harming. I have always struggled with opening up to them for as long as I can remember for about two reasons: i dont feel safe opening up because im either met with frustration, disbelief, and being misunderstood. The second reason is because I’ve always been a closed off person and it makes me extremely anxious even thinking about opening up to them because I don’t want them to be upset because of how bad im doing. My mental health has been fucking horrible the past few weeks and I’m failing my classes and in my house grades are basically equal to the worth of a person.

200262,"I want to, but I don’t have the courage I used to have.When I was younger, I stupidly tried to end it by taking a random jumble of pills from my family’s medicine cabinet (I didn’t know that none of them would have killed me, but just made me really sick and in a lot of pain). Luckily I got so scared I felt sick and threw them up almost immediately. I at least had the courage to try back then.

I really just want to vent, please don’t post any links or phone numbers to hotlines, I won’t use them. I just want to tell someone something in case I do get brave enough to do it right this time.

I got married a little over a year ago. As soon as we got married we moved across the country to a state I’ve never even visited. All of my family and friend (not friends.) are back in my old state. I have no friends or family here. My husband is a different person than I thought he was. We live with 2 other people and I’m the odd one out. Everyone uses me as the lightening rod. It’s 1 against 3 and I have no one on my side.

I had been seeing things and thinking things that aren’t right or here. I had my dads insurance plan so I saw a therapist (not psychologist). He told me I had major depression and possibly schizophrenia. He convinced me to see a psychiatrist. I’ve wanted to kill myself before but it was pretty much every day for a while since we moved. I had a couple appointments with the psych and she agreed I had major depression but with psychosis. She gave me medication for both. There were a couple of adjustments and I was fine.

I was “happy” every day and didn’t see him for a while. (Him being the man who’s in my head and outside, he has a name and I’ve seen him since I was younger, but I didn’t know it was him). The people in my house keep bullying me and getting mad if I try to say/do anything back. The people in my closet said they were going to poison me if I tried to take my medicine again and kill my husband if I told him. Luckily I don’t think they can see my dog and he doesn’t seem to notice them either. 

My husband and I got in an argument yesterday about how everyone here is against me and I’m not going to deal with it any more. I haven’t talked to him since then. I slept on the couch last night and I don’t want to talk to him unless he recognizes that they are hypocrites and say sorry. I know he won’t. I want to get a divorce but I can’t. If I stay, he will keep doing these things. I actually can’t leave even if I wanted. I don’t have any money to pay for a divorce or lawyers. Even if he agreed and it didn’t cost anything (no clue how divorces work) I would be even more miserable because I still love him. I can’t live on my own, I have no marketable skills and never lived on my own before. I tried calculating how much I would need to make to live on my own (even in a studio apartment, eating nothing but ramen). I would need a full time job at the state minimum, which is the only kind of job I’d be able to get, and the state minimum is actually a ton here. PLUS another part/full time job. And that’s just to survive. No games, computer upgrades, extra anything like sweets or coffee.

At least with my husband I won’t live on the streets. I thought about killing myself all last night. I figured I would leave my parents a message so they know why and that I love them. I played in my head exactly what I’d tell them, how I’d leave it for them etc. I couldn’t stop crying. I felt so pathetic laying on the couch, crying to myself thinking how I’d tell my parents why I killed myself. I can’t live by myself and even if I could, I’d be alone with no one to talk to. I don’t want to talk to strangers. I want my bestfriend and parents. I can’t ask them to pay for me to go back or tell them what I’m thinking.

I want to kill myself so bad but thinking about how sad my parents would be breaks my heart. Also I’m a coward. I know where my husbands gun is but I think even if I grabbed it I wouldn’t be able to pull the trigger. If I did, my husband would have to deal with it. I honestly don’t think he’d care that much anyway. I think he might be surprised. Like “oh shit my wife just fucking killed herself” and he might be scared cause I can’t imagine he’s ever seen someone he knows dead on the ground by their own hand, but I think that’s about it. I suspect he’s tired of me and wants a divorce but he knows I wouldn’t make it on my own.

I’m sorry if you read all of this. I’m hoping most people didn’t because I just wanted to tell someone something. I thought about just typing it in my notes and leaving it there or deleting it, but something about someone actually reading it gives me comfort. I lose either way, whether I die or not. The only difference is if I actually die, I won’t have to worry about feeling sad for my parents cause I’ll be dead.",suicide

Lost first job out of college and apartment at same time, had to move to buttfuck to move back in with parents, had a series of shitty menial jobs, met a girl, lost friends because of girl, she cheated, developed a kink to stay in relationship with girl, lost girl anyway, can't get rid of kink, had the worst psychiatrist and psychologist that probably exist, started drugs, lost teeth, gained weight, my current job is a soul-sucking mindless job that should not even exist, am so pathetic I have friends I can't stand because I don't want to fucking be alone.

To top it all off I watched Sunset Limited last week...  

My life is fucking meaningless.  

It's gotten to the point that I wake up even more depressed because my dreams are better than my goddamn life.  Seriously.  Dreams about having a girlfriend.  Makes me fucking want to cry when I wake up and realize that the person I cuddled with in my dream I haven't seen in 5 years and never will again.  

I used to write.  After college I couldn't get past page one and still haven't on anything.  I don't understand people, I think is my problem.  I don't know why anyone does what they do, for any reason.  It makes no fucking sense to me.  So I swing between thinking people are great/nice and sneaky/evil.

I honestly don't know what to do.  I've tried.  I quit drugs, even weed, which I think might have been self-medicating the depression.  I quit smoking, which now I find out has MAOIs in them and also could have been helping depression.  Nothing I do is right!  And what does it matter?  Should I just go for broke, heading for rock bottom?  I don't want to end up a drugged out homeless guy with aids.  Or do I clean my shit up and head for a monastery somewhere to get away from everything.  No shit, both of these sound good to me right now.  And I'm an atheist.  

I can't take it and if something doesn't change I'm worried what I might do.  To myself or even to someone else.  Because if I snap in the wrong place, I don't know what could happen.  The drugs messed with me somehow, I have many more violent thoughts than I used to.

200284,"Running Focused (94) Try. Try Again. It takes time. Remember to think and take a step back and ask yourself, what am I doing this for? Success of course is totally fine. We all want to be successful but remember what builds longevity is impact.

Day to day balance looks different day to day. Funny thought? Let me explain a little. The focus of today will be different then the focus of tomorrow. Routines and habits are important but something that is important is to focus on the radical thought, on the radical growth and learning. 

The energy that is put into one thing today, most likely won't be the same amount of energy you put into it tomorrow. Day to day balance, 10/60/40, 30/50/20, 25/50/25 and so on. 

Remember though that we have to fill our cup up first. Something that I always struggled with was being there for everyone (which is very important of course) but being there for everyone first, before myself. I learned through the past few years and ultimately my whole life until this past summer, that I must be there for myself first to then be able to be there for others. Focusing on things like meditation, stretching, getting outside daily, journaling and doing things that are just for fun like painting, video games etc, will help to increase my mental strength and capability to be there for others.

**FILL YOUR CUP UP FIRST !** You will then be able to fill up an extensive amount after.

**I love you.**

I don’t really have anyone to talk to, but I feel the  need to get this out. I’m not sure what I’m getting out, though. I’ll probably delete this at some point. 

I really want to die. I don’t really feel much anymore and I don’t know why. 

I tried to ask my mother for help, but I was told that depression does not exist for people as young as myself. I was called an attention whore and basically got ignored.

When asking my family didn’t work, I tried asking a friend at school. She was basically pissed and told me that I didn’t really hate myself and that I just told her for attention. Her evidence for this was the fact that I am apparently more successful than her.

I’m sharing this here in the hope that someone with understand, so please don’t reiterate what others have told me about my life. I know that I am better off than others, I am just trying to deal with emotions that I don’t understand.

I’m a straight A student. I started college over the summer when I was 15. I was president of my school honors club and future business leaders club. I’ve won awards at business competitions. I’ve been told that I am pretty. 

I still have never really been happy, as far as I can remember. I was born to two methheads, which resulted in some reoccurring medical issues. I was adopted by two good people, but when my father died my mother became an alcoholic. She did hit me, but I don’t think it was enough to count as abuse. I attempted suicide at 13. A friend of mine found out and made me promise not to try again until I turned 18, because he thought that he could change my mind before then. Social services took him from his house a year later and I never saw him again. 
I kept to that promise, though.

Currently, I don’t have any friends. I had the friend that I recently told my problems to, but I decided to cut her off because she was making things worse. She made me feel bad about my feelings and thoughts. She also told me that people only talk to me because I’m pretty and I help them with homework/class work. 

I am also beginning to hate my family. They don’t take my issues seriously and they make me worry constantly about their health because they are either drinking themselves to death or overworking themselves. My stepdad works 24/7 to help him forget that my mother is out getting drunk. My mother no-longer hits me, but tells me that if she wanted to, she could hit me and I couldn’t hit her back because if I did my siblings would hate me. My family also values opinions by age. Therefore, even if my sister is strung out on drugs, her opinion matters more than mine and if I disagree with her or openly dislike her or something she says, I’m in the wrong. My mother has also began speaking badly about me since she found out that I was both atheist and into girls.

Even though I’ve accomplished a lot, I don’t feel like I’ve done anything at all. I don’t have anyone to stick around for. While I do have a successful future because of my grades, I don’t have anything that I’m really passionate about that would make good money or use my academic talents. 

I’m not 18, but I don’t feel like waiting, anymore.
All I do in my free time is sit around and think of ways to off myself. 

My only problem is that I see life as a gift. It is unlikely that any of us exist in the first place, so I feel like it’d be a shame to throw it away. At the same time, I feel like all I do with this gift is feel bad about having it. So, why not throw a useless gift out?

Just needed to vent for a bit. I don't know where to start. I had a shitty time back when I was in middle school (tweens are fucking cruel), in fact during that time I had my first suicide attempt (overdose miserably failed), though these past 3 years could possibly be the worst I've been. These days I worry about what comes after I leave school because I can't even handle school by itself. I hate hearing about my birthday because it's another year that I'm unfortunately alive. I've been wondering if anything really matters, the answer is always no. I don't care about school anymore, I only show up so they don't send my parents to court. My grades are undoubtedly shit and I'm definitely failing classes; I don't even think I'll finish school. I'll stop eating because I'm not worth wasting food on. I'll cut myself in class, in the bathroom, during lunch, and at home. On my way home I fantasize about getting run over by the schoolbus, maybe taking a detour to the bridge to hang myself on. I've tested the waters a bit by choking myself with a jump rope to see what it could feel like to hang myself. I know my family would be devastated but I've already gotten past that. The only reason I haven't killed myself already is because I don't want to leave my dog, although slowly I'm getting past that too. I've been wasting everyone's time and energy with my presence. My family tries very hard to help me and even sometimes I like to think about what it would be like to be older, but I know that even if I don't kill myself now it will happen some day. I've gotten a new fucked up way to cope meanwhile by looking at pictures of dead people and serious injuries; it makes me a bit jealous that I can't be in that position.",suicide

Ive been suffering from depression and OCD for almost 10 years and have been and currently still on medication 

So basically i graduated medical school in my country a year and am currently doing my transitional year which is basically a year you get to rotate in every specialty to see which one you like and want to specialize in

For the past 3 years Ive been ditching and leaving early on most days to prepare for 3 examinations called the usmle so that i can apply for a specialty in the US

So i almost have no clinical experience at all especially with procedures ive almost done none and have barely scrubbed into surgeries

My transitional year is almost over and lately ive been getting thoughts of extreme regret and shame on all the clinical experience i lost and all the time i spent studying instead of being in the hospital and practicing to become a doctor

I really feel like shit and wish i never entered a field that is so tough and demanding
To be honest i really just wanna end my life and get rid of all the mental pain that i have from the shame

Ive scrubbed into only a handful of surgeries and rarely ever did any procedures, even if i end up doing well in my exams how the hell am I suppose to even survive during my specialty training

I recall how sophomore and junior year I had nobody to sit with at lunch, so for the entire 2 years i sat alone in the counselors office, sometimes I would just sit in there and cry. Nobody ever offered a hand, nobody ever helped me. 

Being 18 is supposed to be a magical time for many teenagers. For me, I don’t ever want to fucking remember that bullshit ever again. I was bullied because I was ugly, they virgin shamed me; girls rejected me in the worst ways imaginable. I hate myself so much I could fucking punch through a wall right now.

If I had a gun I’d be gone by now, but I signed away my right to buy one when I committed myself to a hospital last year.

And I feel such existential dread due to the mystery of life. It seems so pointless. I don’t know how being dead feels but in my mind there’s a decent chance that it beats a depressed life. Even if it’s simply the absence of consciousness, feeling, and time then it beats life. My imagination likens it to the state of deep sleep where we aren’t dreaming.

I didn't think it really helped. It just seemed forced from their end and they wanted to get me off the phone as soon as I said I wouldn't do it tonight.

I have problems I guess. I know they're more than some but less than others. My right testicle is in constant pain. I've never had a girlfriend. I'm balding. I have many deep acne scars. I've never gone on a date. I don't feel like theirs a purpose in my life. I'm smart, but I'm no genius. I have no special qualities, except for not being able to attract anyone.

I spent grades 8-12 online basically. My friends were all online. They never cared about me, and I would always grow to detest them as they showed how inconsiderate they were.

I've never been to a party. Didn't go to the grad party or evening ceremonies, even though I was the valedictorian. I have a strong phobia of dancing. Absolute phobia. If I had to dance I would most likely have a panic attack and stop moving or speaking completely. I also can't have music to listen to. That is also a phobia that none of you would understand. I don't listen to music because I am afraid of picking music I like, even though I might like listening to music.

I'm living by myself in the city with no friends.

I'm signed up to study physics at university even though I have no idea what I want to do. I don't want to do anything really. I'm sick of work and tests and having to see people who don't notice me. I'd rather live in the basement.

When I was 13-16 I would perform sexually for people online through video. I know some of you wouldn't consider that a big deal, but it has destroyed my self worth. I can't look in the mirror without seeing a horrible person who ruined himself.

My nose is also big. It's very ugly. Some have asked me how I'm able to see with my nose there.

I also have excessive perspiration. It doesn't cause me to have excessive body odour but I get pit stains. Antiperspirant doesn't work.

So with no relief that it didn't work, it affirms that it's what I really want. The emotion of the whole thing did make me cry for quite a while. It's always the thought of my mom being told what I've done that just wrecks me. But no regrets about attempting it.

Why I'm at this point: I've been having a rough few days. Well, week. A rough few years actually. Been lost in myself and my desire to participate in the ""rat race"" for years. The last year/year and a half, has been constant thoughts of suicide and death. You wouldn't even believe the amount of thinking on this I've done. Apparently I should have went with co1 rather than co2 but I read some stories of really bad sickness occurring from co1 when you use a car that doesn't have catalytic converters, which my car doesn't have. But I'm surprised the Government/Google hasn't contacted me somehow for how much google'ing i've done on this. Ways to do it, painless ways, ways that look like an accident, ways that always work, and on and on and on. I'm not made for this world. I don't think like a normal person. Little else occupies my thoughts past this. Not in the typical ways of: I lost someone, I get bullied, I'm disabled in some way, I'm broke, I don't like the way I look, I'm lonely, etc. I hate life in spite of those things. The better my ""material life"" is, the worse I feel inside. People having real problems in this world and I have anything but. I just have a fucked up brain. About 4-5 years ago something in my brain changed, and I've been trying to come to terms with it everyday since. It was like I was an artificially intelligent being that suddenly became self-aware. I began to reflect on everything before, during, and after every situation I was in. I can't just have a conversation with someone like I used to. No, I'm in a constant pressure cooker. While I'm engaging with anyone and everything I'm constantly having inner dialogue with myself. What is the right thing to say? What is the best response? Too much eye contact, look away. Now that's not enough, look back. Did they notice that? Where is my arm? What did they say? I wasn't even listening because I was thinking about my facial expression being strange and natural. Did they ask something about me? I don't feel comfortable talking about myself, mention something else so I don't have to answer questions about my day or week because all I do is think about how much I hate living. Now I'm going to spend the next week thinking about how they're probably off put about me as I didn't open up with them and never get past the barrier of casual friends to, true friend.
Hundreds of casual friends and only a handful of good friends. Only one 'true friend' to be honest. And he doesn't even truly know me 100% as I just can't go there. I can't be me as I'm afraid of me. This is just one issue. I constantly feel down on myself as I don't have anything to offer others past 5 conversations. The worst part is I generally don't care past the first conversation. People are nothing but the filtered selfie they post everyday as they act like the reason they posted the picture isn't because it's about them and their fake mask. To pile on, everyone is the same. I've been all over this country, and I've met people from all over this world, and everyone is the god damn same. And I wish that I could just fit in, sadly. I wish that I could walk through life talking about dank memes at the water-cooler and hang out with my friends on Saturday about how me and that same group of friends got ""so wasted that one time."" I wish that I could get past the 3rd date with a girl and not want to strangle myself when I think about how I've had these conversations 200 times before and how fake I'm being in my interest. I'm a bad person for that. She doesn't deserve that and I certainly can't continue in it. This is me, this is my hell. I should be happy in every possible way, why can't I be happy in just one way? I have advantages in almost every way a person could in this world. I'm smart, not ugly, athletic, white, born in the USA, work with millionaires that are helping me to become my own, have great health (not mental health I suppose), have a great family. Have all these things that are easily taken for granted by so many and millions would give anything to have just some or one of these things. And yet I still wake up everyday wishing that I didn't wake up at all. It's one thing to be unhappy, but when you have no real reason to be unhappy? Well then you just fall down that much more on yourself. 5,000 children in Africa under the age of 5 die every day of starvation, and I want to kill myself for no good reason I can find. My brain is broken and I don't know why. I've tried to fix it. My mom has gone above and beyond (even by mom standards) trying to help me fix it. She knows the place I'm in, but I've kept the seriousness of it from her for the most part.
The past year she has helped me with brain scans, supplements, doctors, tests, programs, therapists. She's spent countless hours and thousands and thousands of dollars to try and help me but I don't think that I've been honest with her about it. I haven't been honest with myself either. I wanted these things to work. In the beginning I thought they might, but as time went on, it was easier to see that my problem isn't something that can be 'talked out' or a problem in my brains function that can be found with a type of scan or test. This is just me and I don't want to be here. I don't like the way the world is and I don't want to participate in it. The only thing keeping me from doing something about it thus far was the thought of hurting my mom. People will be sad and I wish that this was possible to avoid, but people will move on. I just can't say enough in here or my other letters how much you've done for me, mom. I know you'll think that you could have done more. you couldn't have. There was no one else that could have possibly helped as much as you did. Certainly no one could have done better. Mom, you did more than you ever could have, needed to, or should have. You understood a lot of what I have felt this past year, but I don't think you could know how unreachable I really am. I couldn't be honest with you about that because if I told you the real thoughts in my head, you wouldn't have let me be alone. You would have done whatever was necessary to keep me safe but that isn't the right path for me. I wanted to tell you every time you asked me how I was. I wanted to tell you everything but you would have probably put me in the hospital. You would have done something and everything to keep me from hurting myself. If I can be this sad with the life I have, then being in a hospital is only worse. There is no way to fix this other than one thing. Now I've been laying in my bed for 2 days strait now and you've called because I'm sure everyone is wondering where I am and why I haven't answered anyones calls. You're worried and I wish I could answer and tell you what is going on in my head but I can't. I know you would drop whatever you are doing and drive strait to me. I love you. You're the most genuine person I know. You're the only person that honestly cares about everyone else before herself. You're the only person that has kept me holding on this past year, but I can't hold any longer. I'm sorry. I love you so much but please understand that this is me finally being happy. This is the only way.
People say that suicide is a cowards way out, that it's selfish, and that it hurts everyone but the person that does it. I think that's true but for only half of the story. What about the pain of the person that would cause them to do it? How long have they been suffering with something? How many times have you thought about killing yourself? Have you ever? What if your mind thought about it once a week? Once a day? What if you thought about it all day everyday for more than a year? This is my hell and it's anything but selfish. Barely holding it together for the thought of hurting my family and friends. But it's just too much for too long. These past 2 years has felt like 20. I can't stop these thoughts. No matter how good of a day I've had or how amazing of a time I had hanging out with friends or my family, these thoughts still consume me indefinitely. Just as in the more material success I achieved made me feel worse, the better my day was, just made me feel more depressed. As in, if I can have this good of a day, if I can have this amazing of a date, or this much fun being with my friends/family, but I still have these feelings every 30 seconds? Why? Everything is faked. All the work done, all the questions answered, all the test results analyzed, all the breakthroughs made, and all the while it's worse and worse everyday where I'm screaming in my head and wanting to put my car into a wall. I don't think anyone would wish this on anyone they care about. I wouldn't wish this hell on anyone I hate. I've tried to fight this. I turned down prescription drugs cause I was afraid I'd use them to overdose. I didn't get my motorcycle out of storage this year cause it would be too easy to wreck it. But the pain is too much and if it's selfish, then I have to be selfish. I'm sorry. I want to be happy. I will finally be happy.

UPDATE:

Okay so it's been about 18 hours since I posted this. The plan was to go through with attempt #2 soon after I posted that. But I was pretty tired, obviously since I only got 4 hours worth of sleep while breathing in dioxide for most of it, so I decided to regroup and come back to this in 24-ish hours. I figured I owed that much to the situation/universe since the first attempt failed. I'm glad I did, but I'm still going to proceed. I will reply to individual comments in a moment but I want to say thank you to everyone that shared in here. My insurance cut off so I haven't been to my therapist in months so it's nice to talk about this freely again. Putting all this down has been helpful. So again, thank you.

So this day had a couple ups and boy did it have it's down. I woke up about 10 after catching the other half of my 8 hours. My plan was that I was going to put in a full day of moving around, being outside, and talking to people that call/text. And I was going to treat myself to amazing food too. So I did all the things I enjoy (at least I used to) and ate all my favorite foods. Pretty good morning. but the main thing was the 'down' I mentioned a minute ago was a bit after lunch. I was sitting at home thinking about what I wanted to do next and my mom texted me. I ignored her texts the day before cause I'm a piece of shit and I couldn't bring myself to talk to her. But this was something I was hoping would happen. I was 95% sure she'd reach out. She knows if I disappear for a few days it's because I'm not in a good place. So I have to figure out how to face her with this situation going on. I tend my friends puppy a couple days a week and I was already thinking about going over there as not much makes me happy these days, but that little pup does. So it's perfect, I'll tell my other buddy I'll take his shift today and I can meet my mom over there. The puppy was a perfect distraction/mediator. So anyway, we spend about an 45 or so minutes talking in the backyard. We talk about various things but mostly about how I'm doing and about this new supplement/vitamin type thing she wants me to try. The whole time I feel dead inside. I'm screaming so loudly that I can't hear at times. I'm just playing with the dog, keeping myself distracted, so I can keep it together. What kind of person could be this way. She cares so much, she is trying everything she can to help me and I'm completely dead inside. As much as I love my mom, the only thing worse than breaking her heart like this is my constant hopelessness and pain. I'm freaking out inside, doing everything I can to hold it in. This is literally the hardest moment of my life. I wish that I was the typical suicidal person. Depressed because I feel like no one cares or because I have no loved ones. Then I could just checkout and not have this terrible guilt on top of the depression.. But I know my family cares. I know she cares unmeasurably. But I have to do this and I know a few things which get me through the guilt. I know this will not end. This is not a situational phase. There is no cure. The only possible treatment is drugs? I doubt that and they will lobotomize me anyways. I've given this everything I could to fix or adapt to it for over 5 years. I've done serious relationships, womanizer life, to sworn off women completely. Fell in love, fell in lust. I've traveled for months on end piss-poor, I moved across the entire country for a year. I changed careers 2 different times from good job; good pay. Fun job; crap pay. To now it's dream job; insane pay/potential. I've tried everything from living in a tent, living on a futon, living in a party house, hippie house, grownup house, to downtown apartment to myself. Tried living as a degenerate with no responsibilities for a year, to living the high life as a bachelor and everything inbetween. I've partied my ass off and experimented with all sorts of drugs, to now I've smoked weed maybe 3 times in 6 months and only sometimes have one drink with dinner, usually not even 2. Point is, I hate it all. Every single place and lifestyle I've lived, I end up in my bed; watching tv or sleeping, it doesn't matter cause I'll do either for a month strait. I'm tired all the god damn time. I don't want a wife, kids, a mortgage, a 401k, a life. I dread going out and talking to people every fucking day. I don't like my old friends, my current friends, or any new ones I meet. Everything leads me to the bed. Nothing has changed today, nothing will ever change it. So at least I know that... But today I got closure with my mom. I just have to do this knowing that she'll understand I'm at least at peace. I'm a piece of fucking selfish asshole. If hating me means it's less pain, then please hate me. I hate me, but at least I did my best. If there's one peace I have, it's that I know I tried everything possible. 

So anyways... I seemed to go on a bit of a vent there. But long story short; We finished our conversation, I kept it together as best I could and gave her 3 hugs, and said goodbye. I ran inside, laid down with the dog and balled my eyes out until I fell asleep. Woke up, went home. Fuck dinner. I'm ready now. Just waiting for the middle of the night to go find a garage. Fuck this I'm so ready. Everyfucking day of misery is about to end. ",suicide

Please help me.Hi Reddit i am new here and i please need to seek someone to talk to me about my serious problem that has been going on in my life that i been dealing with for the past 5 years. I dont want to deal with no mean comments. Currently i am 20 years old and in the year 2015 i dropped out of high school as a sophomore because my frustration with school got the best of me. It was a really stupid idea i understand and i really regret it from the negative outcome and the anxiety it has give me. I am extremely anti social to the point were my mind with the real world is gone and i get really scared with anxiety to step out of my house which is my comfort zone and meet people or even step out to go to stores. I use to work full time labor work which was my first job and it felt amazing to actually go out all day and work but i never went back because i never got called back in. I never have had a real job were i apply and i am scared my anxiety always holds me back to step outside my house. Money is a serious problem with me i always end up wasting it all instead of saving it for something useful in my future. My all day routine is to be on my phone, Tv, eat, shower, and sleep and do the same thing over and over again everyday. I basically only go out somewhere like the nearby stores for only two times a week or just be in my friends house and stay inside there for the weekends for sleepovers. I know i will be judged because im not independent but i just cant help myself no more but tell the world how really serious depressed i am. My family is somehow supportive of me but i know they cant do much for me because i am already grown but they still tend to let me be me on my own. I dont have nothing going on in my life right now guys. I dont have no girl friends or guy friends. I only have one friend who is supportive. I am really scared i will be the same for the next five years till i am 25 and i dont want that. I have no motivation or strengths. I take my vitamins to give me a boost in my life which somehow it helps but i know that i need real medication for my anxiety. I am thinking about applying to Goodwill to finish school and get my GED but my anxiety really turns me over. I get suicide thoughts sometimes and i dont want it to get worse as i am beginning to be in my early 20s. I am scared really scared and alone guys.

200367,"Do I deserve any respect?I am posting here because I would like to get some objective opinions on a matter which bothers me. I've recently been through a painful breakup and yesterday I contacted my ex to try and get some of my stuff back, which he borrowed from me. During our short relationship he had to deal with some of my depressive episodes, but I thought he didn't mind that. And this time I made the mistake of mentioning to him that I do not want him to contact my family in case I die because he would just make them view me in a bad light (during our relationship I did some things which I'm not proud of). Indirectly, I implied that I'm feeling suicidal.

To that he replied that if I don't stop acting so immaturely, he will tell my family himself everything about my suicidal thoughts. He said that my mental illness is only made up because I like to feel sorry for myself and he blackmailed me, giving me a short period of time to adopt some random cats and dogs (I know, this is so random and messed up), knowing that I cannot do it because of my job and my landlord not letting me keep pets. I am totally frightened now because if my family ever finds out about the extent of my depression (or self-pity) they might force me to move back in with them, which would completely destroy me. I would much rather die than have to move back in with my parents. 

This leaves me in a bad situation, and it seems like death is the only way out. Besides, I am sick of being labelled as an immature coward. I keep trying to get better (I've had years of counselling and taking medication) but my ex says that I am not doing enough, I'm faking an illness and I do not deserve any respect. And I feel like he might be right, because maybe all of this is just a load of attention-seeking on my part. I used to believe that everyone deserves to be respected but now I am starting to think that maybe I'm an exception, and I'm  just a worthless coward who is better off dead anyway.

I am going to enjoy the time with my little boy, I am going to a gig with a person very dear to me and once I return I am going to end this pain and sadness once and for all.

   When a person decides to finish his life  there is nothing much that can be done or said to change his/her mind and, sadly, this is the case for me. I am resolved in committing suicide, have been resolved for some time now, I might add. Shameful as it might be perceived for the stranger kindly reading these lines, for the op its the only way to handle the pain I have caused myself and my close and beloved ones.
   Why haven't I, if so committed, killed myself? Well its not a matter of resolution but one of empathy. You see when I am dead I won't know, obviously, anything more than my ending and that will thankfully be it. Afterwards my friends and family will feel my fall, this I know, the horror and pain of “what could I have done?“ would follow. And that has been my setback. You see, I have been kept alive not for my supposed recovery from depression but for what it might mean for those who stay after my intentional death. After so much I dont have the heart to just dont give a fuck for how they might/will feel. That is the only decency I have left.
   
 Your first impulse will be, maybe, to try and save me, to change my mind. If so I am grateful for your reaction and know yourself that your heart is big, strong and brave so much as to embrace the condemned, for that, this meaningless pit of life as we call it lightens up enough to make it worthwhile. But, as it is, for me it isn't a reason to stay. Not now, not ever.  I have fucked up my life in ways I can't count, and my sins have no absolution, this I know as well.

  So, that being said, I want to stage my suicide as an accident. Some ideas have come to my mind these last few weeks but there are, as I think and scrutinize, always traces to my intention. Hence the irony of posting these words into the suicide watch. I need advice on the method of killing myself in order to spare my people the pain that comes after my resolution, making it appear as something that couldn't have been revoked by any intervention whatsoever. 
Know this: my end will come at my hand, your intelligence can serve to ease the pain the people I leave.I know it won't be, whatever way it comes, easy on them but yes, lighter than knowing why. If interested please pm me, or post in the thread your answers will be a blessing.

200377,"I was very close to ending things yesterdayIt was finally the right time to do it . I've been pondering it for 6 months or so . Called suicide hotlines like crazy to the point where some workers recognised my voice after a while . 

I was a horrible person in my teenage years . I had a drinking problem and now that I'm sober I can see clearly all the damage I've caused . I was such a fucked up person. Some of it I can't even blame on drinking it was just my character and disgusting brain . I don't know why I acted the way that I did . 

Anyways it was late and when I thought of ending things for the first time I didn't feel fear or tension in my stomach I felt at peace . It was almost spiritual and mediative like I finally accepted that it was okay to go now . 

For the first time in months I felt relief from the daily hell that I live in  . Not yoga before bed relief not saying good things about yourself relief not talking to a friend relief . Pure calm and stillness .


I tried to hang myself with a guitar cable but that didn't work . I didn't know it was so hard I just assumed you choked yourself and you fell asleep.

I walked to a bridge to finish the job but it was cold and I didn't want to feel the pain of hitting the ground . I called the suicide hotline and the woman sounded so terrified and scared that I didn't have it in me to put her through me dying on the phone .

I walked home and now I'm here again . Another day in pure agony that will not stop unless I self medicate or end my life . 

Someone please for the love of God help me .",suicide

200379,"I need youI started the day confident and a little hungry. 

I'm always hungry nowadays because I force myself not to eat. I do not feel that I am worth that much effort. I use the word ""feel"" because I know I am just as worthy as anyone to be alive but I am still struggling. 

Today was different, I allowed my body food. I had family come over to my new residence to help me clean. I felt loved.   I am glad to have my family and friends. They have always been there for me. I sincerely wouldn't hope for a better family nor better friends. 

Furthermore, I have an amazing job. Everybody around me are people I deeply care about and I wouldn't want to hurt or bother. 

Nonetheless, today everything felt bland. Every day for the past years felt more of the same. I've always failed to see purpose in all of this. However, not living wouldn't give me any more purpose. 


More recently than before I find myself deeply interested in suicide. I'm looking for a way to kill and dispose of my body at the same time. I do not want to cause any trouble to anyone close to me. 

I have recently contacted a local hotline for suicide prevention. I know that some day I would have been satisfied to let them clean after me. I didn't do this to prevent me to reach the same ending. 

I have already, briefly, brought that subject with one of my close friends after being advised to. I did not feel any progress nor felt understood. 

I'm trying to move on after I have been pushed out of a 8 years relationship. The breakup happened a week ago. I know this is the reason why I am more vulnerable at the moment but I've always felt gray and lifeless. Having her in my life kind of gave me a purpose for the last 8 years. She was colorful with a lot of passion for things I couldn't have imagined somebody would care.

Today, just like every day of the past week, I feel that I am back 8 years ago but with responsibilities regarding everybody around me. I've missed my chance back then to vanish before causing trouble. 

Please give me a purpose, poke me directly, add me and just tell me what makes you want to live. How can I possibly move forward now?

Yeah, for the first decade of my life, my parents would sit me down and explain to me the difference between right and wrong, and I was a good kid. But then there was some infidelity, we lost the house, and they got divorced. That’s when they acted like I was supposed to feel sorry for them. Yeah, the 11 year old feel sorry for the 38 year old. I’m almost 26 now and the neglect I’ve received from them for the last 15 years has made me feel suicidal many times. 

Yeah, I’m an ass and I’ll always talk back to authority and anyone who speaks to me in a rude, authoritative, or belittling tone.

200384,"I wish i wouldve died in my car accidentI dont feel like acting upon my suicidal thoughts, i just always have them. They get pretty bad at times, down to where it will happen, how, what time, etc. I believe i have bipolar disorder, but my psychiatrist does not think i do. I go through phases where i am extremely depressed, and phases where i want to do everything and try everything and sign up for classes and paint and record music and more and more. In my bad phases, i get angry and beat my face and head with my fists, i dont cut anymore, but i have gotten back to beating myself up, and i have made several painful bumps on my head. 

When i am depressed, i vape extremely heavily. I quit doing it every day for a while, but on my bad days ill do it for hours. Ill get a little disposable vape and use 3 in a few hours. Even with the law change, i find sellers who are willing to sell to me (im 20) and i use my old stuff i had before the law change. I think its stupid and refuse to follow it. I dont believe the news headlines saying its bad for you. I dont believe something thats helped me so much can hurt you. I dont believe the hype. I also use kratom. Its an herbal tea that you can get in powder and capsules that affects your opiod receptors. It turns them on similar to prescription painkillers, though not as strong. Without kratom, i would already be gone. 

I dated a 31 year old man beginning when i was 15 years old. He got me into sending pictures and videos to him. Im sure you know the sort. I was with him until i was nearly 20, when i moved back home from living with him. He doesnt believe what he did was wrong. We truly did love each other. But he destroyed me. Ever since i have gotten home from living with him, i have not been the same. I have thought of suicide more often. I have changed methods to more secure ones. When i was living with him, 6 hours away from home with no one besides him, i attempted suicide near him. He did nothing. He stared at me with a blank expression and screamed at me for misusing my medication. He didnt save me. I brought myself to the hospital. And then i left for home. 

I was depressed before i even met this man. I began feeling depressed at 12 years old and thought of suicide since 9. 

A few months ago, i was in a major car accident. I was tboned by a truck going 60 mph right on the drivers door. I broke my pelvis in multiple places and suffered a mild concussion. It felt like a curse. I was so close to death, and i didnt even make it. I often wish i would have died. I dont know why they bothered saving someone so hopeless. Im now 20 thousand dollars in debt from the accident (it wad my fault) and have no way to pay it. I have constant pain in my pelvis. Ive neglected help because of the cost. 

I was in therapy and a group therapy. I quit because they were charging me thousands of dollars. Insurance refuses to cover treatment. I cant afford therapy. I tried making an appointment, and they told me insurance would not cover it. I believe the mental health field is nothing but a scam out to get your money.

I have very unusual opinions, just look at my reddit. Im an antinatalist, a nihilist, an athiest, and a true believer in the belief that life means nothing. Please dont preach jesus to me. I had a very traumatic past with religion. When voicing my opinions online i have been told to end my own life, that no one will love me, and that i am worthless. 

I feel like this will never end. Treatment is too expensive. I feel like i will have no choice but to end my life within the next few years. Im terrified of growing old. I dont want to die a slow, painful death. I WANT to die by my own hand, and thats what scares me. Sorry this is all over the place.

200407,"Just a disappoint and loser of a person venting (0 structure just wall of text)have never used Reddit before, honestly don’t know what to do anymore. It’s highly unlikely anyone will see this or give a fuck but just wanna get shit off my chest.

Currently am a student and seems like everything is going wrong. These online classes have completely screwed me over and I have no clue how to recover. The grades I used to have were the only thing that was even remotely good about me. My problems are minuscule compared to everyone else on here and I’m not even suicidal, just wish I never existed. 

I’m lazy as fuck and have zero drive whatsoever to get my life back together. I have no friends and nothing that genuinely makes me happy and I’m not even in adulthood yet, if I can’t even survive this I have full confidence that in the real world I’m going to struggle even more. I have a loving family which is why I fucking hate myself, I’m a disappointment and a failure. My sister and my parents are all hard working and I’m the exact opposite, shame is eating me from the inside but because I have no motivation I don’t care enough to fix it. 

I hate doing this shit too because I feel like I’m just an attention seeker and I’m making a mockery of people with real struggles. I don’t have depression or want to commit suicide, I just wish I was never born so that I wouldn’t disappoint my family. My parents got me a therapist which didn’t help me in the slightest because I can’t open up to people and I felt bad about wasting their money. They’ve done everything but because I’m so lazy and hopeless nothing works and at this point I don’t believe that anything can help me. 

Going to cut it off here, I’m just repeating myself and getting nowhere. If anyone read whatever the fuck I just wrote I hope that you don’t relate to me in any way, and if you do I sincerely hope things get better for you.",suicide

200412,"My mom has breast cancer and now I feel like I can't kill myself despite wanting toHer prognosis is exceptionally good, they found it in it's early stages, but she still needs chemo and the whole nine yards. I had been suicidal for a long time before this, it has been steadily getting worse lately. I don't have a job, I usually like to make art but I can't bring myself to make any. Everything feels so tedious and pointless. I've been through all of this before, I've tried medication and therapy but nothing works for long. I did have a good long run with medication that worked and a good therapist; it worked until it didn't. Then the medication stopped being effective, then I lost my job, then I gained 30 pounds, then I got close to attempting, but was interrupted. I guess I'm lucky because I do have people who care about me, and the only reason I haven't attempted is because I'm really afraid of traumatizing them by them finding my corpse, but I also don't want to traumatize a total stranger either. I'm also afraid of how expensive funerals are and it just feels shitty that I can't just poof from existence. That being said, I do keep something hidden in my closet that I could use. It feels almost like a safety blanket, knowing it's there and an option sometimes makes me feel better. But it would be really shitty if my husband came home to my smelly corpse. 

This was all present before my mother's diagnosis. I went with her to her first chemo treatment and have been holding it together pretty much for her. She knows I've been suicidal, but I don't think she's aware that it's an ongoing thing, and there's absolutely no way in hell I'd tell her now. I feel like I have to keep going until she's in remission because I don't want my death to stress her out and risk her recovery. My family needs her, she's like the keystone holding everything together. I don't know why I'm writing any of this out, maybe I just want to vent somewhere that no one will force me to go to a hospital or knows me personally who will be upset by it. I just don't want to be alive anymore. I'm so tired of it, it feels so exhausting all the time. I've had so many interviews that went nowhere that eventually I sort of gave up, and now I think the gap in my resume is looking too big.

200416,"Finally decided how and whenSome context: my boyfriend left me out of the blue a month ago and soon after made every effort to ignore my existence. He was my best friend before we got together. He literally made life better by existing, even when we argued. He made life feel more exciting. I don't have much support. I tried talking to a friend about it who only told me to stop moaning and get over it. 
I've cried everyday since he left. I hate how my existence made him miserable. I hate how I ruin everything good by just existing. I don't expect anything more good to come out of my life and if it did I'd probably just ruin it again. My life has been a lot of loss and pain and I don't want to do it anymore. 

I've decided on the best time to do it and how.

I know people might think it was just a man but honestly I've never ever felt so right... Like it felt like everything had aligned itself for true happiness when I met him. And now he's gone and despite him saying he still loves me and wants to be friends decided soon after I wasn't even worth talking to at all. And I agree. I'm shit. He and everyone else is better off without me.

Next was someone I reconnected with at her service. I hadn't seen him in years, so we started hanging out and stuff again. He never told me he had a pill problem.. he probably knew I would have stopped talking to him... he overdosed a month after we got close again.

Two days before that, my friend from high school was on his way to work when his power steering went out while he was getting off the freeway. His car flipped and his neck snapped on impact. 

This year has been emotional torment. I said I couldn't handle any more losses. Then an hour ago, I get a call from my friends mother telling me that he lost his battle with cancer...

I thought my life got better when I found this friend of mine who got close to me and we talked about everything under the sun. Eventually, we got together after 11months of friendships. She is my classmate so we spend a lot of time together. We broke up after 2months and 9 days of relationship on 23rd of march. It was depressing and she blamed it on my insecurities. But for the previous few weeks, she has been constantly talking about another boy who is her junior and her orientation kid(means that she is his orientation group leader for the school). They got close and started talking much more and she gradually talk to me less. She said that she will never like him or be with him but in the last few weeks of the relationship she started sending me pictures of him whenever i say i want to see her and also started talking a lot about him in our conversations. He asked if he can join in on our dates and she just accepted it without thinking about my feelings. She also got her parents to send him to school. Something which i have always wanted but was never accepted. And within one month of knowing him, she already let him catch a ride with her to school in her parent's car and talk to her parents. This is despite after knowing her for 1 year and 2months, she never let me see her parents and go to great lengths to ensure that her parents dont see me. At the same time, she also go to the library to study and invited him but not me. She would also rather go home with him than go home with me. She just make me feel insecure because of her actions yet she maintain they will never be together. In the past week since we broke up because of my insecurities and how she couldnt handle it, she started not talking to me and ignored me, and in front of my face laugh and talk and be happy around him. They started sending hearts to each other in the messages which i happen to see because she text him in class, something she never used to do. She also broke the promise that she would only skype me and no one else but today, she skyped him and I know because i asked her since she is online on skype today and she rarely is on other days except to skype me.

At the time i got the information that he wanted to kill himself, I just stared at my phone and did nothing. NOTHING. while my friends where searching for him, I was lying in the bed.I thought it was his choice,to do what he wants. I may have saved him, if I had gone to search for him. But I did not. It hit me when I was at his funeral, and met his mother. She was crying. My friends kept telling me that he was selfish, becouse he left us like that. But a few weeks ago,the same friends tried to commit suicide themselves. On the same weekend. One of them cut his wrist and the other one tried to blow his head off with a gun. Fortunetly,they both survived. I felt betrayed.And as if that wasn't enough, now they're trying to kill each other. They got into an argument, and one of them pulled out a gun.

200429,"Finally gut my courage up to write here...I'm anorexic. I've been anorexic for almost a decade... until I got better. I lost so many friends to this destructive, soul-eating disease... but one day I managed to somehow get up and start taking care of myself... I started dating an awesome girl and really fell in love head over heels. Then I relapsed. I want to vent, but even writing about how we met and how I lied to her hurts too much. I was confused and my eating disorder was coming back so hard and fast that I couldn't handle it. I asked reddit what to do back then ( [the reason I even started my account](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xw4ee/im_a_male_anorexic_and_have_been_keeping_it_a/) ). At the end I chose the cowards way out and I didn't tell her. I left her, told her I didn't have feelings for her anymore and that I didn't want to see her again. I tried to overdose the same night but failed. Just woke up the next day covered in vomit. 

It took me soo long and so much courage to attempt that one time and I was so disappointed when I woke up again, that I have been too afraid to try again. But I've come close. I'm still trying to work up the courage. And if a final suicide attempt won't kill me, then my eating disorder will sooner or later. My weight is lower than it has been my whole life. I've been admitted involuntary to hospitals at higher weights than what I weight now, which is why I haven't told or seen anybody in weeks now. I'm just waiting for this to be over.

I miss her every day. And I've broken off all possible contact to anyone related to her. I hope she will never find out what happened. Because I know, if she finds out she will blame herself and I don't want that. She has suffered so much already. I can't. I just can't let that happen. I never should have dated her in the first place. And the fear that she might find out about my suicide and about my eating disorder is the only thing that has actually motivated me to eat something from time to time. But I'm sick of it now. I just want it to be over. My energy is almost non existant. I already had to make 7 breaks while writing this because I get dizzy if I sit up too long. My bones hurt all the time now. And for two days now I've had really sharp pains in my chest. I haven't eaten in 4 days straight. I just want this to be fucking over!! I'm too much of a coward to shoot myself, so if my eating disorder doesn't kill me anytime soon I want to take pills. Which actually fits... For a decade now I've been told: ""Only girls get eating disorders. Men don't get eating disorders."" And now I can't even get myself together to shoot myself like I should. 

I just wish I would have done so a long time ago. And even NOW I still hope I won't have to do it myself and that my heart just stops beating before I get the courage to take the pills. I really hope the sharp pain in my chest is my heart. It HAS to be. I've had problems with my heart before. I pray to god that it's finally giving up. I know I'm a coward for hoping that, but I really can't take it anymore. I'm just gonna die a coward. It's not gonna come as a surprise to anyone anyway.

I’m trying my best to be there for him and give him whatever he needs telling him to go visit her if that would make it better and even time away from me if that will help him heal. He has overwhelming feelings about her which I insisted was very normal considering he shared a life with her at one point in time and values her life and her as a person. I’m not sure if this was an attempt at manipulation either, but I assured him I was alright with this and I’m trying to be as patient and understanding as possible to assure I can give and provide what ever he needs to cope with this . The only issue is he insisted on breaking up with me due to the fact he’s constantly thinking about her , I assured him it was okay and these thought were very valid and normal and we can work through it .

200442,"My life story, I guessI’ve contemplated suicide so many times for a long time. I’ve had severe depression since I was 11 and I’ll be medicated for life. I’m almost 18. I haven’t left my house in years (since I switched to homeschooling at 14) other than to get a refill of pills each month. Even then, I can barely force myself to get to the doctor’s office. I hold it off until the withdrawal symptoms get really bad.  The depression started off with me losing interest in everything. I was into gymnastics all my life and then suddenly I wasn’t. I didn’t wanna go there, didn’t wanna go to school. I started skipping when I could in grade 7 (I was 11) I had no friends and no one really cared about that weirdo with no friends. Such a loser, am I right? Anyway, grade 8 it started getting worse. I skipped a lot more and got in a lot of trouble for it. My home life wasn’t so great at this point either. I mean, my dad and I always clashed. We would fight whenever we spoke, it would result in me crying, blah blah blah. I can’t remember much from those years because I pretty much tried to forget everything. Still had no friends at school, I always felt so lonely and I knew no one cared. Literally no. one. cared. That’s really why I skipped, I was so lonely and felt so embarrassed.  It’s funny how your past shapes you. I spent years being unwanted by everyone and hated being alone but now all I want is to be alone. I have no interest in the slightest to even socialize let alone leave my house. I’m getting side tracked, I do that all the time. So, where was I? Grade 8.  I think I skipped more days than I attended. Grade 9: new school, new people 
The pattern of having no friends continued. I was never one to initiate conversations because I wouldn’t wanna bother anyone. No one really spoke to me first. Because for many years no one seemed to like or care about me I always thought it was because of my looks. I must be ugly. That’s when my insecurities started. (7th grade) my insecurities control my life to this day. To the point I want to kill my self because I hate how I look. I need a slimmer jaw, smaller nose, bigger eyes, bigger boobs, bigger butt. And maybe if my eyes weren’t black as coal that would be nice too. Plastic surgery is a thing, sure. But not everyone has rich dads that will pay for that kind of shit. 

I remember when it was lunch, I hid in a bathroom stall so no one would see me sitting alone in the cafeteria. Pathetic, I know. I could barely talk to people. I would talk like “y-yes I just (pause) signed in” I was too nervous to even talk properly. Around this time I started taking pills for my depression/anxiety and my social skills DID get better eventually and I was able to talk like a normal person once again. (My social skills got worse and worse in the span of grade 7 to 9) 

In grade 9 I believe I attended 2 weeks of school in total. I got in huge trouble, parents were gonna get sued. (But they didn’t, thank god) 
Grade 10 is when I switched to homeschooling.  I of course had to do grade 9 work because I basically missed out on all of grade 9. At this point I still had hope I’d have friends and be happy like everyone else appears to be. I fantasized about that often. Such a CRAZY concept. I imagined what it would’ve been like if I had friends. How my life would’ve been different. I was always alone. I had no one. I don’t have my mom to talk to, the only one I had was myself. No one but myself. I knew I was alone in this world. Slowly I realized that and gave up on my silly fantasy. Over the years I just lost interest in people and whenever I have the chance to socialize, I genuinely don’t want to. I actually find it dreadful to talk to people now. Still my insecurities are there, I’m still lonely but I don’t care about that anymore at least, and I’m still a failure. The idea of life is silly. We live to die so why would it matter if someone ends it early? The point of life is literally meaningless. If you die, assuming heaven and hell aren’t real, you would just be dead. Nothingness. Your existence wouldn’t have even mattered. But if hell is real, you’d die just for more endless suffering. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. I’m tired of hating myself for how I look. But after all these years my opinion has changed on society. What I’ve learned is no one cares about me, people are fake, I’m alone in the world. Yes I want to be alone. But I can’t remember exactly when that started. Probably not long after realizing I AM alone. I can’t trust people. I don’t have anyone, I don’t need anyone. But am I just lying to myself? Does a part of me still want a normal life? No. I don’t. I just wish I wasn’t born. This was useless and meaningless. My existence didn’t matter, it was just filled with wasted years, crying and over thinking.  I don’t know why I’m writing this. I just needed to get it off my chest. Before writing this I was thinking about ending it. But I’m not sure anymore. The truth is, I’m scared of the possibility of hell. So if I must, I’ll exist but not exist at the same time. As I’ve been doing.. it annoys me how I’m wasting my youth. But what good is it anyway if you aren’t attractive? That’s all that matters to people anyway. I always over think things and ALWAYS think of the worst. But I have to entertain the idea that the worst possibility is true because it may be. 

I didn’t go into detail about things because I already knew this would be insanely long. Who knows if anyone will read it anyway?",suicide

200444,"I've reached my breaking point.I'm 18(F) and I live in the UK. I've attempted suicide three times, the first time was in 2011 and the last two times were last July/August. I ended up in hospital in July, they got me better (just general hospital - not a psych ward or anything) and sent me home with home-treatment from the crisis team. Within a two weeks I was back in hospital. When they were discharging me, they said I didn't need to be admitted into a psych ward or anything. This all occured about a month after CAMHS stopped treating me because I turned 18. They said I wasn't bad enough to be referred to adult services.

I have a wonderful boyfriend and a 7 month old puppy who is literally the only thing keeping me alive right now. But today (and for the last few weeks), I've been feeling really suicidal. My family dynamic isn't very good. I haven't spoken to my 94 year old great-grandmother in weeks, my grandmother refuses to speak to me and my mother is out of the house 95% of the time.. she only comes home to pick my dog up and get changed. Then she goes to my grandmothers for the evening and doesn't come home until 9 or 10 o'clock. 

I'm honestly at the end of it all, I can't cope living in the same house with the same routine for the next 7 months until college. My dog isn't getting the best care she could and she's so much happier when my mother looks after her, my boyfriend is going to University in September and could find someone who didn't have so much crap going on. His parents don't like me because of my mental health, they think it causes me to be manipulative and they think I'm using him.. which is absurd, but I've never really had anyone like me except my boyfriend so it doesn't surprise me.

No one thinks I'm ""bad enough"" because I don't get hysterical every time I'm really depressed. I don't remember the last time I cried. 

Anyway, I really can't do this any longer. It's too hard. I've already ruined my life because of my mental health (can't join the Army because of suicide attempts, my education is pretty much over etc). I just give up. ",suicide

200457,"My therapist treats me like a kidEvery time I go to a therapy session I just end up feeling shittier than when I first got there. I feel as if my therapist doesn't treat my problems with respect.

 Instead of talking about my trauma and finding out how it effects me and my view of the world, I have to literally color in pages on things I feel confident about and fill in worksheets about how to talk in ""I"" statements and ""how hormones effect your mood"". I already know all of that shit, and I feel like I'm in a kindergarten class and the teacher is trying to explain to me that ""other kids have feelings too"". 

I try to talk about my father's refusal to treat me as an individual with my own thoughts and opinions, and her response is ""have you tried telling him that??"" No shit Karen! what do you think I've been doing for my entire life? But the very problem causes itself (he doesn't see me as an individual &gt; I try to tell him I feel disrespected &gt; he doesn't care because he doesn't see me as an individual). 

I try to talk about my hygiene issues and my apathy towards taking care of myself because of my self loathing and suicidal thoughts, she replies ""you know you need to shower, right???"" OF FUCKING COURSE I KNOW THAT?! does she think I'm secretly five?? I feel like I have a better grasp on all of my problems then the fucking trained professional does. What's even the point of showing up to sessions?

What's worse about this is I don't have the opportunity to switch to another therapist because I literally can't afford it (I don't have any health insurance; I'm currently in an optional pay program). This also brings up a lot of other problems, like the fact I've had to switch therapists 3-4 times and I can't get close enough to any of them to feel emotionally comfortable with talking about deeper issues.

200476,"I need help moving forward  

I feel weird typing this, I’ve lived with phases of depression and anxiety since I was 11 when I first established an idea of how I could best kill myself. I’ve managed until tonight at the age of 22 under the idea that eventually I will die regardless, and my odds of finding some concept of happiness cannot be guaranteed in whatever state there is after death that our limited minds cannot reasonably conceptualize. 

This last year, and January more specifically has been difficult enough that for the first time in 3 years I have been considering it again. However with my understanding of the human body from the course I’ve been studying the last year, I do not believe I will fail if I try. I have considered seeking help from an organisation, but from the same course I also know the procedures and codes of professional standards relating to someone categorised as a high suicide risk. Without doubt in my mind I would be institutionalized, at the very least temporarily.

3 years ago I met a lovely lady, she is about 5 years older than I, at the time I was training to join the ADF, I marked in top 10% of all applicants, I was offered a pathway to all bar 1 job within the ADF, if I went back to highschool and completed a year 10 equivalency test, which I had never done throughout my years of homeschooling. I had also been working 35-40 hours a week between filming football and performing overnight/maintenance shifts at a Mcdonalds. Out of pride and arrogance I spited the idea of going back for a test that I had already proven myself competent of, and turned my back on entry to the ADF. The lovely lady I mentioned already comforted me and we started dating long distance. Early in the relationship she had stressed the idea of having family and being married before the age of 30, which I carried to heart until last month. After a year together, I used the money I’d been pocketing for the 2 years prior and moved across the country to live with her. After 6 months I hadn’t managed to find a job, was very nearly broke and had put back on 20 of the 30 kg I lost in the process of trying to join the ADF.

At this point I got a job at a factory, started working 40 hours a week, on a complete different sleeping schedule to my partner and no friends within 500km of me. Within a month I was coping with heavy alcohol usage which continued for the next 2 months, until just after I’d had my casual contract ended to bring in a new wave of overseas labour hire, who weren’t being paid the additional benefits that citizens were, within 2 weeks of losing that job my grandmother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At this point I reduced my drinking to a quarter, got a new job doing maintenance work again, began discussing with my partner ways I could get a qualification, while continuing to contribute financially. Things were looking good. We had a plan that involved my moving back across the country to begin studying nursing, which would also provide me some of the skills to help take care of my grandmother and take advantage of a government initiative which involved paying for my study fees completely.

Within 3 months my grandmother passed. Living with my family again, I had taken on a good chunk of the household management and listening/supporting while my mother talks of how she wishes she was dead and the weight she needs to lose and how she wants me to help do that. Coming forward to December, I had saved my last few paychecks from filming football, skipped meals, avoided luxuries so I could save enough money to fly to see my partner again. Every piece of university work I could do I had done, lecturers knew I would be away during the break and my partner and I had been discussing getting married, she’d asked if I would want her to take my name, talked about dates, best men and bridesmaids. The only detail that was missing was a proposal, so for this coming trip I planned to fill in that blank. I made plans to make a ring from the files and tools I’d restored from her grandfathers neglected workshop.

Within a week of the trip to visit her, without any mention of a proposal, she left me. Stating feels of anxiety about what she wanted and that I’d always felt more than her, that she didn’t know if she actually wanted a family anymore, I found out in this same trip that she’d joined a new gaming group, been made an admin for it, met half a dozen new guys within this group, all 3 months before my trip, having never mentioned it.

I’ve spent the last year trying to meet new people, classmates, new gaming groups, just as friends. Even tried some R4R posts and meetnewpeople reddit pages. With no result. Even offers to be invited to parties that I’ve accepted from classmates, the inviters either deflected me trying to get details after I’ve accepted or simply never got around to it.

And now I sit here, alone, broke, studying a course that I do not take satisfaction from, in a household where I have become emotionally depended upon. Slightly tipsy from having gone to a pub to try and meet new people after having read it as advice from a reddit page on meeting people, only to not have the courage, having spent the $25 I had set aside to buy a cricket ticket from my brother, on 2 fucking pints of guinness. I feel confused, betrayed, weak and a failure, with no clue how to interact with people anymore.

In my first couple of years I excelled and had the best grades in class without effort. I was always distracted and lazy though. I could never really 'focus' on my work and often rushed it off. I was also active as I participated in cricket and athletics. 

Long story short, I had good friends but was bullied a lot. This started to affect me negatively in fifth grade when the bullying became so bad that I absolutely hated going to school. My grades dropped and I was miserable. Eventually my parents found out about it and I switched schools. I was diagnosed with depression at age 10 and put on anti-depressants. 7 years later I still haven't recovered and I'm back on anti-depressants. The bullying incident lead me to become anti-social and distrustful. I never formed any friendships in High School and my grades are very poor.

200499,"I've Become A MonsterWhen I was a kid my parents never seemed to care about/for me. My father used me as an emotional punching bag, taking out his own fears and inner demons on me. He eventually was diagnosed with clinical depression and has been on meds since. My mother acted as my existence was an inconvenience to her. She never once acted as if she cared if I was around. Only speaking to me when she wanted me to do something or to yell at me about something I had done. Somehow I managed to put this all behind me and became what I thought was a decent human. Treated everyone right, never fought or gave anyone grief regardless of their deserving it. I had a pure heart and let those around me know they could trust me with anything.


The only big event in my life was moving to another state. I left my friends, family, and pets behind to move closer to my mothers side of the family. I gained new friends, few of witch I actually keep in touch with anymore. Eventually about sophmore year of highschool I started noticing that everyone in my grade had at least had one relationship. I began to regress and become solemn in my own world that I would never have love. But I found my first girlfriend junior year. We were inseparable, always together. I loved her, but as the first year of our relationship had peaked she began blaming me for all of her problems. Everything that went wrong was because of me. She started giving me hell about how ""You have changed"" and that I wasn't the person she fell in love with. We broke up close to senior prom and excluding some FWB moments we stopped talking.

Junior year was also the year I met her. Every guy has had one girl who they wanted to be with, but thought they never had a chance. No shot, for sure. But we became friends, and eventually what I would call a best friend. After school we didn't talk for almost a year when out of nowhere she began texting me, talking to me over FB. We were close again. She revealed to me she was unhappy about her current relationship and that she desperately needed to get out. I did my best to remain unbiased, giving her the words I thought would help. She stayed with him for a short while longer. But she started coming to my work and talking with me/hanging out. 

They broke up and the next day she was at my house. We hung out and talked. It wasn't long before she kissed me and we started dating. I couldn't believe that my best friend of 5 years was going out with me. She was drop dead gorgeous. Funny, and shared many of the same interests. It was the best 4 months of my life. Then out of no where she started acting differently. Making excuses not to hang out with me. She started sleeping in more, ignoring me a lot. One day she brings all the things I had at her house back to mine. She said it was because she was tired of it just laying around, but it troubled me greatly. None the less I tried to shrug it off as nothing. One day I got a ride to her house, slept with her until she had to leave for work. Figuring she would be gone for 8 or so hours I slept until about 2am. She told me she would be out by 2 or 3, so I watched tv and waited. Around 4am I called her, she said she would be home soon and that she was just hanging out with the morning crew. At 5:30 i had finally lost it, she would have rather spend 2 and a half hours at work than come spend time with me. I started walking home when she picked me up.

The following will always be regarded as the worst day of my life. I basically lectured her about how I felt like I was the only one who cared at this point(we had been together 5 months now, so a whole month had gone by of her ignoring and putting me off) and that it seemed like she didn't care if I was around. Then I asked the question I wish I had never asked, ""Do you even want to be with me."" and she whispered ""no"". That was it. 5 years,  5 months of the best time of my life and it was gone.

She went on to tell me that we had moved to quickly and she hadn't had adequate time to heal from her previous relationship. So I spent the next 9 hours begging her to stay with me, begging for a chance. She constantly said no. I told her that if I had to leave without patching this up, then I would never be able to see or talk to her again. She cried what I now assume are hallow tears, and said she was sorry.

Within a week she had already found another guy. After telling me that she moved too fast with me, and that she hadn't had time to heal she had already moved on from me. It's the point I felt a change. I was no longer the nice, golden heart bearing man I once was. I had snapped, all of the years of being shit on, all of the years of giving people second,third,fourth,hundreds of chances I had been stepped on enough. 

I absolutely snapped at her, sending a plethora of text messages depicting how I felt, calling her every name in the book doing everything i could to release the tension. It's been 3 days now and she's stopped replying to my text messages. I would too with everything I've said. The old me would have never done that, he never would have unleashed such utter anger and despair, even telling her I was going to kill myself because of it. And that's where I am. In a few months I'll be 21. Legal age to purchase and consume alcohol. So that's my plan. I'm going to purchase as much alcohol as I can and just drink until I don't have to worry about waking up anymore. Maybe smoke a cigar, do the little things that still make me happy like playing CoD and listening to music. There's no sense in telling me to call a hotline, or trying to help me.

200517,"i think I just got my sign to kill myselfI’m away from my family, 6 hours away with my girlfriend who takes care of me and feeds me and provides for me while I’ve gotten fired twice. I’ve gotten into two car accidents with her car and all I do is cause her trouble. I love her so much and I know she loves me but she can’t handle what a drain I am and I hate seeing myself drag her down. 

For three years she’s been the only reason I haven’t killed myself. Because I didn’t want her to deal with the consequences. but tonight she talked about all the things that are wrong with me. Yelled at me for getting into anothwe wreck. Spoke about all the things I hate about myself and all the reasons I think I’m better off dead. 

I know it will hurt her. To find her girlfriend missing or worse, dead. But I’ve been holding myself together so she wouldn’t be alone and with no money comin in and no passion for life at all, am I really with her the way I should be? She just admitted to wanting to break up with me finally if I don’t get my shit together but I don’t know how guys. I really don’t. 

I really can’t do this anymore. I don’t even know if I try really hard or not at all or... I just don’t want to do this. I hate where I am and who I am and I can move all over thdon’t country but I can never learn to like myself at all. All I do is cause misery for others and I’m tired of burdening them and watching them pick up after my failures. 

I just hope that in my next life I know how to learn from mistakes and can be better. 

I really really wanna be better. 

Haha, I’m crying so hard but still so quiet so she won’t hear me. If you read all of this thank you so much. This is a great board for helping people out of suicide and just it being here makes me happy, objectively. That strangers will help strangers so willingly.

200520,"Link between depression and food chemical intolerance. More common than we realise.My son committed suicide three and a half years ago. One year ago my 25 yr old daughter had to be urgently hospitalised because she was suicidal. I have since discovered I have an intolerance to the food chemicals salycilates and amines which cause me severe IBS. 

These two chemicals are also a known  cause of depression in sensitive people but it seems not to be very widely known, which is why I recommended the website www.fedup.com.au  It has probably saved my daughter's life. (This might not be the same for everybody, but there is nothing to lose by being informed). 

My daughter has not had any dark thoughts or depression since starting on a salycilate and amine-free diet. It is a remarkable change in her that is obvious to all who know her - including her psychiatrist. We are hopeful she will be able to gradually stop her medication soon. 

Significantly, this intolerance runs in families. Several people in my family have suffered severe depression, including my grandmother, mother, aunt, niece and cousin. My niece also committed suicide at the age of 36 and my cousin at age 19. It is most likely they were all intolerant of these food chemicals without realising it. 

Doctors are not trained to know what effects food chemicals have on different people with intolerances, and wrong treatment may be given. Changing what you eat is a challenge to start with, but well worth the effort to find out if this is the cause of your depression. Link to more information and success stories:

200521,"I think I'm doneI'm sitting in the laundromat as I write this, and I think laundry is essentially the story of my life. I look forward and my life is just an endless cycle of laundry. It gets done and then it gets done again... Rinse and repeat until death. More and more, my entire life seems to come down to the apparently endless repetition of mindless little tasks like doing the laundry. The laundry's never finished, never completed, and I never really get anything out of it. I just have to keep doing it in order to go on.

My problems started a few years ago. I've no idea why or how or by what mechanism or for what reason, but suddenly life held a lot less pleasure. All the excitement attached to specific achievements and successes seemed dulled, all the pleasure attached to normally enjoyable activities seemed muted. I started using drugs as a quick-fix, and this worked. I knew it wasn't an entirely healthy workaround, but it was an effective one, and one I didn't notice the downsides to until they had done irreversible damage. It seemed like I had happened upon the cheat codes for existence. Rather than constantly working the complex controls of an adult life, carefully navigating my way through the looping, labyrinthine rat race of my career and tip-toeing along the bullshit tightrope of a work-life balance like some demented trapeze artist, all for diminishing and increasingly long-term (i.e. essentially virtual) benefit, I just had a few levers to pull. The simplicity of it, the sense of control and self-mastery, complete power over my state of mind and thus my reality (although I see now that it was only my experience of reality)... Intoxicating, liberating, utterly irresistible. I thought I was happy.

Throughout this, I did have an exceptionally loving and supportive long-term girlfriend, whom I can only describe as impossibly perfect. Words fail me. I struggle to describe her in terms that don't sound like greetings card cliché. Our connection (“connection” doesn't even cover it; it was more of a... union?) was perhaps the only truly genuine, authentic part of my life. She just completely got me. She spoke my language in a way that no one else ever has. I suffer, intermittently, from fairly severe social anxiety, but I would barely need to splutter out a couple of ill-chosen words to someone and she'd be able to perfectly capture, condense and express the great maelstrom of thought roiling around in my head. She could basically read my mind, anticipate the course of my thoughts and emotions. She knew how I'd feel about something before I did.

What she couldn't deal with was the drug use. Looking back, I wasn't myself, and I think that's what it was. She and I had this connection, so when I ceased to be me, that connection was no longer there. The drugs amplified little eccentricities until their roar drowned out my personality. A perfectionist tendency became an intensely neurotic obsessive streak. I made her a fruit salad one evening, but wasn't entirely happy with the result, so for the next 24 days, she'd get an ever-so-slightly tweaked watermelon-based fruit salad every evening. She once joked that she felt bad because she always arrived five minutes late for everything to find me there waiting, so I began religiously turning up six minutes late. These are a couple of the tamer examples, and I'd rather not go into the worst of them. 

Needless to say, this quickly began to drive people away, but I found that I was powerless to do anything about it. I just watched as every significant relationship in my life began to fall away. My girlfriend was still there, and tried to help me quit drugs. I managed six weeks before attempting suicide. I felt trapped, held hostage and savaged by my own psyche, depressed and constantly on the verge of a massive panic attack. After that, my girlfriend and I had an argument from which there could never really be any recovery, and she left.

Against all the odds, I'd managed to remain relatively effective at work. Even though it wasn't always fun and it was often difficult to manage, my work has always been, broad strokes, something that I really believed in. It involved compromises and bureaucracy and the occasional failure, but the overall thrust and direction and purpose was something lofty and great and good. Work became the last little well of meaning in my life, but that only lasted for a short while. After something went very, very wrong, I came to see even my work as hollow and pointless. After having believed in it for so long and it having become my last refuge, its sudden souring caught me off-guard, and my first instinct was just to cast myself off the nearest bridge, an idea I still toy with.

I suppose I've come to realise that I am a person in the world, not just a product of it. My life isn't just a series of events that have happened to and around me, but a natural process of cause and effect. Things aren't just fucked up; I have fucked them up. My life is the organic unfolding of who I am and who I have chosen to be. Things are shit because I am a fundamentally defective human being. This is my life. It's not going to get any better. My dreams are too big. I'm not ok. At this point, I have nothing to contribute to the world. Satisfaction of the most basic demands of being human is beyond me. I can't work or keep my kitchen clean or remember to call on my mother's birthday. I am the sick and the old that slow the herd... I can't keep up. I realise now that the only thing I can offer society is non-participation. I've come to believe that it's my duty to the human race to bump up the average, just a little, and it's obvious that the only way to do that is to euthanize the weak.",suicide

200524,"No sight of a possibly good futureSorry for the way this is phrased, but this is kind of how I feel right now (TLDR, I have nothing to show for me, while everyone around me is excelling)


Have you ever… had that moment, where you realize everything you’ve done until now is a fabrication of your own imagination? You’ve really built nothing which you can show of yourself, no serious friends, hobbies, artifacts of pride or sense of self. You try to let go of what you think you could have been, because it’s all come crashing down that yes, not only is there always someone better than you, with more motivation than you, but that too tired to even try anymore, and everyone else is improving. 


I feel too cowardly to do what other people do every day, and I’m drifting, a lost soul endlessly mourning the bleak future. I have magically obtained an ability to make staring at a wall enjoyable, the vast blankness of a stare more comforting than that of feeling like everyone is growing when you’ve just stopped. I’ve lost at all that I had promise in, someone has stepped in and taken that spot, while my skills simply decline away. WHY ARE THEY DECLINING AWAY? I don’t know. Maybe they weren’t there to begin with, and that’s why I’m realizing everything is a fabrication. Maybe I truly haven’t done anything, while those stupid hobbies of others, I now realize, are priceless. They’re developing during the time of their life where they’re supposed to find themselves. Me? I’m twirling around lost, wasting away everything I thought I’ve built. Nothing holds any large means in my life anymore.


I'm a freshman in high school, but one who was told on the regular that they would be great, largely considered one of the most academically excelling, kindest and extracurricular excelling people in middle school. I don't mean to sound arrogant, but that's where I think I was. People would thank me all the time for helping them, I was starter of three sports teams over the course of the year and first chair in orchestra. Now I'm a 2nd string, falling asleep in class, low GPA who can't even bother to help other people or care. Everyone who I thought was ""meh"" (and I feel so guilty about this) is now excelling. My self esteem has taken a large hit, and I can't think about where to begin to feel like a actual person.

Sorry if I sound like an entitled brat, because I probably am, but right now I see no possibly good future and to me, I'd rather not see that happen, and therefore suicide seems very viable, even though I am probably too much of a coward to do so.


How do I get my life in shape? Reattain my grades, and get to the point where I can help others. Possibly get back into shape and make friends, real friends?

Edit: a word",suicide
200528,"My x-post from r/neuro.So in order to understand what I mean, I'll have to provide you guys with a backstory of my life.

So as a child, I experienced alot of suffering. I witnessed my step-father kill my half-sister (he smashed her to a wall, I always think of this scene, it haunts me wherever I go). I was also raped multiple times, and also physically assaulted. Basically I experienced so much in my life, that by now, I should have been dead, in prison, homeless, or any fucked up life (you get the point).

But the thing that prevented me from turning into a crazy person is that I'm very shy. I'm so thankful for this feature, because it truly helped me. Now, I do realize that I can be crazy without acting crazy; and that's what Im scared of.

Anyways, enough of my mental health. Now the reason I made this post because I'm pretty sure I have some type of tumor slowly building up in my brain. The reason I know this, is because of math class. No matter how many times the teacher tries to explain math to me, I just don't get it. I know this has nothing to do with me or the teacher. I know there's a tumor blocking info into getting to my brain.

You may say well how are you so sure? Well, I remember when I was a kid, I used to be better at math than I'm right now. Which doesn't make sense. I obivously didn't become dumber. My brain just grew a tumor, which I'm afraid will ruin my life.

My analogy is that when I was younger, age 8-14, (I'm 18 now), I didn't care about my past. I was just a happy kid who was not the best in school, or life in general, but a kid who could atleast understand things and solve problems (which I can't do now). I also experience these following side effects:

- After standing up from laying down for a long period of time, I feel light-headed, sometimes I almost fell down.

- Sometimes i get confused for no reason. Like If im thinking of something, my brain suddenly shuts down. It feels so weird, it's like I can't control my mind even I try my hardest.

- I have a very short memory (I know this part of my brain is fucked). like If I learn something in class, 10 seconds later i'll forget it.

I plan on quitting high school, because I thstupidityink it's a waste of taxpayer's money, It's a waste of the teacher's time, and my time, and quite frankly, society's time. Because I know with the state of my mind, a 6 years old can be smarter than me. But I see it as a disability, rather than stupidity - If that makes sense.
Hopefully some of you can figure out my problem, or atleast try to understand my story. Please don't tell me to visit a doctor - I'm not asking for an advice, I'm just getting this offmychest to not become crazier.

200591,"About to give my friend my pistol.This semester has pretty much ruined any self confidence I thought I had. I picked up a great job this past December (15/hr, full time) and thought I could juggle that with going to school 12 hrs.. well. It hasn't fared well at all. I am probably going to be asked to leave the Business College at my school after this semester, and from my job performance lately, I think my job is on the line. Not that I am lazy, I just make a lot of stupid errors on paperwork at a blood bank. Which is not taken lightly at all. I am at a crossroads, and I honestly don't know what to do. I work Tuesday through Saturday (4PM-12AM) and I have school Monday through Friday in the AM and I have practically no time for myself anymore or for anyone else. I've stopped going to school on a daily basis because my grades are so far gone, there is just about nothing I can do to bring them back now. Everything I worked towards while I was in the military has pretty much gone to shit, and my prospects to go to law school are long gone now, even though my state will keep paying for school after I used my gi bill so when I heard my mom mention vocational school as a possible route, I figured I am a lost cause. 

The thing is, I am *supposed* to be happy. I am debt free, the gi bill pays for my school and rent, I make a decent amount of money for a college student, (3900/month) it's pretty much everything I dreamed of. I never wanted to leave college with a lot of debt. Except I have no social life, no friends, and girls think I am some creeper because I show up to school sweaty sometimes because I ride my bicycle to school. It's sad, because this wasn't a problem for me a few years ago. I've tried asking out some girls in my classes, but they just kind of brush me aside and hook up with some jock. Not that I should really care, herpes is for life. The only friend I really have is another bike rider who happens to be 17 years older than me (I'm 24, he's 41), who has taken me to church with him on occasion, showed me how to work out, and helped me out a few times when my car was broke down. 

So last night I started having thoughts. I'm not sure about whether or not they are considered intrusive. Thoughts about packing up everything I own into boxes, updating my will, donating blood for the very last time, (I'm O Negative, it would be selfish not to. At least I could ""live"" through someone else.) liquidating my assets and placing it in cash on the table to cover for funeral, clean up, rent for my roommate until he can find another place, then wrapping myself up in heavy duty plastic, placing a brick under my head to catch the bullet/bone fragments, calling the police, so they can possibly be there in time to harvest my organs, and blowing my brains out. And I could do it too. I have a pistol and plenty of bullets. 

The only thing stopping me is what it would do to my mother and my grandmother. My grandmother would literally die. Her heart couldn't take that, and as for my mom, it would absolutely destroy her. And I don't want that for them. So I figured maybe I can just make it look accidental. Like accidentally get struck by lightening when I am riding my aluminum framed bicycle through a lightening storm. Or accidentally get hit by a semi while on my bike. Those might be a bit easier for my mom or for my grandmother to swallow, but I don't think it would ensure me getting killed on impact. I'd hate to live out another year in a vegetative state. 

I know I should probably give my bike rider friend my pistol for a little while. Especially after writing this. But I don't know what he would think of me. He is a really levelheaded person, and I don't want him to see me as weak or mentally unstable. I don't think he would be my friend anymore. He hasn't known me for a year, yet he considers me family. But he only sees a part of me that I want him to see. 

It felt good to write this. And maybe some of you will read it. Thank you to those who did. Obvious throwaway. 

tl;dr: I should probably give my friend my gun. ",suicide

200653,"feeling hopelessI don't even know where to begin... I am 24 years old and I have talked to fewer than a dozen people in the the last 12 years. I have never had a friend.. I was home schooled until I was 11, then everything went to shit. My dad had a series of debilitating strokes which he never recovered from. He didn't have health insurance, so my mom ended up working two jobs to help pay for his physical and speech therapy. All schooling pretty much ceased at this point. After 4 months of therapy, we eventually just couldn't afford it anymore. My dad came home and was almost entirely bed ridden, needing help to get in and out of bed, into his wheelchair, help to go to the bathroom, eating, anything.  I learned to understand his slurred speech and would often times have to translate it for my mom. if I wasn't there she would ask him to repeat everything over and over, and she'd talk to him like he was stupid or deaf. My dad would just look so sad and frustrated at this. After seeing this several times, I made it a point to always be there for him. I basically became his primary caregiver.


This was my entire life for more than a decade with very little change.  My dad's health began to decline steadily in 2010, he was losing more and more weight. He didn't even want to do anything. it would take him up to 30 minutes with my help just to get into his wheelchair, and at that point he looked completely exhausted and would ask to go back to bed after just a few minutes.  it took so much effort to get him to eat anything. I'll never forget how weak and frail he looked towards the end. He passed away in his sleep august 15, 2010. The doctors said he weighed 83 pounds when he was examined. I remember feeling so shocked at this, and I felt so guilty that I didn't get him help sooner. I could of called an ambulance or gotten him to a hospital months earlier.

I have been completely lost since my dad died. My mom doesn't even really talk to me anymore, as soon as she gets home from work she drinks until she falls asleep on the couch.

Occasionally she'll get really upset and tell me I need to learn how to drive and get a job, 
but then she'll forget about it for months only to bring it up all of the sudden and scream at me.


I feel utterly empty and useless. I feel incredibly frightened and overwhelmed just being out in public. I don't even know how to talk to people normally. I have no idea how to make a friend.  I cannot believe that I am 24 years old. In my mind, it doesn't feel like so much time has passed by. I feel like I should be maybe 14. it just seems unfathomable how old I am. I don't feel like an adult.

200689,"Don't know what else is left to doI've been experiencing really intense suicidal thoughts for a while now. It started after I transferred to a new school and made 2 really good friends, my ex david and and a girl named riley. We were all really close, but come January, David dumped me and riley transferred to a different school a city away within days of eachother. Needless to say, I was crushed and have entered a depressive state ever since then. It took a while to get over, especially because my ex insisted on being friends immediately after the breakup, which made it that much harder to get over him. Additionally, my ex had suicidal thoughts, so I spent most of the relationship convincing him not to kill himself. I made some new friends, but when coronavirus struck in March, I wasn't close enough to them to stay in touch. Right now, I'm in a position where I literally have no friends to talk to. I still talk to riley, but she transferred back to her old high school, and is now closer with her old friends. I didn't know her too long, so that makes staying in touch kinda hard. 

I was in a super bad place for a while, but staying home kind of cleared up my head. That was, until I had to deal with my parents full time. It was as if I had traded all my social issues for family ones, and I felt like there was nothing I could do to escape this sadness that was slowly engulfing me. 

However, I tried to use this as an opportunity to reach out to friends from my old high school, and my old best friend lila who I had fallen out of touch with. For a while, things seemed to be getting better again, and I truly felt like there was someone who genuinely cared about me. However, my anxiety persisted and the thoughts came back. I started thinking of ways to actually do it: firearms, hydrogen sulfide, suffocation by nitrogen, carbon monoxide poisoning. The fact that I could only think of one person who would care if i died didnt help. 

Right now I think I'm at my breaking point. School is about to start, I've been isolated for months, I'm behind on college applications, I'm taking on a huge workload this year, and I only have 1 friend. What's worse is that I got really wasted with lila a week ago and confessed everything, my depression, suicidal thoughts and plans on how to do it. She was sober, and I'm sure she was really freaked out, but I remember making her promise that she wouldn't tell me anything when I was sober if I didn't remember. Of course, I woke up remembering everything and felt awful. I scared away my only friend and set this awful burden on her. I pretended like I blacked out and she just said that she loved me. Since then, she's been acting kind of cautious around and me and I can't help but think that I've ruined my only stable relationship. My parents are toxic as hell, and I know from my past suicidal experiences, that telling them would only make things worse and for sure drive me to killing myself, as things have never been as bad as they are now. I think I'm really close to doing it and now have the resources to do it as well. I just don't know what else there's left to do.",suicide

I've attempted suicide earlier and I got into a hospital because of it, so now I'm taking antidepressants and talking to a doctor every so often. And honestly, it doesn't help all that much. They actually only gave me much more stress and I felt only worse afterwards, but I can't even kill myself without a suspicion now. I could probably at Monday, tho. I might actually try, if I won't chicken out. But for now all what I can say is that it's not possible to even kill myself nowadays. Great. I don't know what to do with my life, I don't see a point in suffering through it, there's nothing but problems ahead. Sometimes I'm thinking how normal people even feel.

As you can imagine from the title, the post may be quite long. Since I write this paragraph at the very beginning, I can't say for sure how long it will be and I won't alter it later.

Addendum: Maybe I'll re-discover this post someday and wonder about how stupid at was at the time.

Just to let you know a little bit about me: I'm 22 years old, male, and about to finish my B. Eng. within the next year. Or something like that. Also, English isn't my main language, so in case you find spelling or grammar mistakes, please point them out so I can improve my knowledge.

I guess everything started relatively early. As far as I know, my childhood was not the happiest you can imagine. I was a dickhead, more or less antisocial, almost got thrown out of elementary school for sexual harassment (no, I'm not a teacher) and pretty much fucked many things up. Some years ago, my dad told me that as much other children sang and laughed, I cried and complained. I'm still doing the latter.

5th grade, new school. It started more or less unspectacular (you know, new people, but still the same old shit) and I even managed to find some nice friends, but things got dark when I entered 6th grade. I'd say it's a key experience in my life when I got sick from this one stupid spoiled sandwich from the gas station in mid-2006, because ever since, I'm struggling with chronic stomach pain and nausea. Also, this was the first time I had suicidal thoughts. I don't know if you ever had the experience of feeling nauseous for weeks a time, but I can guarantee that after a while, you want it to stop - one way or the other. Thankfully, the nausea and stomach problems have slightly improved with the years, but everything else is pretty much the same as then. Maybe because of different reasons.

6th grade also was the start of years of more intense bullying than before, something I never really managed to escape, although it seemed much more subtle in the later years of school. Except from that one asshole that's, until today, the only person I'd really punch their teeth out. Otherwise I made peace with the bullies and eventually even became friends with some of them. Sounds strange, but it's true. Things change, people change, and the assholes from the past are maybe just too egocentric to see themselves damaging their folks around them. That doesn't make them better people, but much more relatable.

Anyways, the real shit is still to come.

After graduating high school, I originally thought about starting an apprenticeship in a local bike shop, but didn't sign the contract because my future boss turned out to be a racist asshole with an ego way too huge for his lack of social skills. As we know, the latter two often go hand in hand. However, I eventually ended up in college, in a course I'd still say was almost perfect for me. Sadly, I did not last long and switched to my current course, Automotive Engineering, after just two semesters.

This current course is maybe one of the things in my life I hate most. I hated it more or less from the beginning but believed the older students who said it'd get better in higher semesters. Now I'm about to enter the 8th semester and it still hasn't gotten better, only worse.

In addition to my permanent lack of time, money, motivation, I developed a sometimes mild, sometimes severe form of social anxiety while the depressive and suicidal have thoughts stayed with me for the last 12 years. Often, when I was afraid of something, I became nauseous or got a severe stomach ache and whoops, I got an excuse not to do it. This could be a visit to a friend's birthday party, simply leaving the house to go to the pub, doing whateverthefuckyoucanimaginewithsocialinteraction and so on.

Basically, my mom did a great job at encouraging me to spend time with my friends while also preventing me from going to clubs and bars and staying with my friends until late. When I turned 18, I was somehow supposed to magically make up for all the stuff I wasn't allowed to do until then. Hang out with friends at bars and in clubs, going to pubs for a few drinks and so on. I still don't like going there, partly because it just feels so wrong and I still sometimes hear ""No, you can wait until you're old enough,"" in the back of my mind. I realize that the time to start these things is slowly running out.

Before you think I want to blame my mom for the things I don't do, although I always wanted to do them... well, it's not completely right. It's true that I had a very boring youth, and I'm very sure she only wanted to protect me from harm. Maybe it backfired a little bit.

Other than that, she was the most encouraging and motivating person I knew. I could talk to her about all the problems and... well, even though I trust no one completely, she was the one I trusted most. More about that later.

So now that I'm almost finished with college, I have to do an internship in my future field of work. I got a really good opportunity and used it, so now I have like the perfect job for my needs. Organizing stuff, driving cars, and so on. And still, I hate it all.

To get the job, I had to move out of my parent's house. Which is... technically not correct, because at the time I left home, it was my brother's and my house. My mom died of cancer a few months ago and ever since, it feels like my life is getting even worse. Not only that she was (despite quite a few arguments) my favorite person, but after she died, my dad, who had to leave a few years ago for absolutely stupid reasons and his own bullshitting, moved back in with us. Aside from being my dad, I'd rather like to see him as an acquaintance. I can get along with him for some time, but having him constantly around me is a pain in the ass. His form of encouragement is way less subtle than my mom's and primarily focuses on finishing college so I can get a well-paid job, rather than getting a job I really want to do.

As I said before, I had to leave home and move to a city half a country away where I couldn't find a room until now. So basically I sit here with an underpaid internship (below minimum wage) in an overpriced $1700, 100 sqft guest house room with a cold, dark  shit-house next door and a shower in the basement directly beside the washing machine and the tumbler that's frequented by the guest house's employees. Basically everyone can see you when you take a shower. The thought really makes me uncomfortable and the anxiety to do it is like the end boss of a video game, only that he respawns after one or two days and I have to kill him again. He levels up from hitting me while I lose these exact XP.

I tried to find a room, preferably in a flat-sharing community, emailed many people and only got replies from commercial providers who wanted more or less the equivalent of a kidney as a deposit and charge a shitton of money for their stupid single-room flats.

So well, here I am, alone, burning money as I write this, being stuck in a college course I hated almost from the start, in a city I never wanted to move to, without the opportunity to even do something useful, without my cat, without my precious PC I built for seven years and a stable internet connection, even without a proper toilet and shower.

In the last months, I lost my mom, at least temporarily my home and most of my friends, and gained nothing from all that except for disappointment.

Suicidal thoughts have often appeared during my journey through time and space, and they may be my most loyal companions. After over a decade of them accompanying me on an almost daily basis, I'm tired of living. I haven't even told you a tenth of my story. What's written above is a rough overview over what happened in my life. Maybe it's only there so you can feel some kind of relationship to me instead of me being another block of text in this sub, posted from a throwaway account.

Before you ask: Yes, I've tried to get professional help. It wasn't much use and after it made everything worse and me getting the impression that everything should normally be okay and there was no reason to feel bad, I stopped going to the therapy sessions after about a year.

It's not that I want to die, hell no. I'd really prefer a life I can truly enjoy, but every choice I made in the past seemed to make things worse. I did my research on suicide and the methods and finally concluded that living a life additionally suffering from the consequences of a failed attempt isn't worth it. Plus, I promised a friend I wouldn't do anything stupid. Until now, I've held the promise. But I can't guarantee that I will hold it forever, given that suicide is always in the back of my mind and creeps in my thoughts pretty much every day for over 10 years now.

As I said before, I'm tired of living. And I wouldn't mind if my life ended right here, right now. That would make this post my final notice. Certainly not the worst way to leave.

(Also, if it really is my final notice: I want my body to be burned and the ash dumped in the sea, so no one has to fuck around with my grave. This last paragraph may sound stupid at the end of this post, but that's actually how I want it to be done.)",suicide

On top of this I missed a 1/3 of a school year because I was in the hospital and we have exams in two weeks which I'm not going to do well on.

I'm new to Reddit and I'm posting now for the first time cause I feel like I need to talk about it and see anyone else out there gets it at all? I feel very alone and I don't know what to do.
 
It's 2am where I am and it's another sleepless night for me, I've always suffered from insomnia and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I am so aware that mentally I'm not doing great, and feel low and it doesn't make sense, I have a roof over my head, a loving family however small and broken, and a loving supportive boyfriend, and yet it feels like there is this constant shadow over me, my brain feels clouded and to be frank all over the shop. More and more recently I've been seriously questioning is me being here worth it? I struggle a lot of days especially recently to get out of bed, I feel completely worthless and useless in life, my brain works (as many of you experience) constantly working over drive on negativity and it's exhausting. I just want this to stop, just all of it to stop. I don't want to die, I just want my brain stop this shit.

Tonight of all nights it really feels like too much, and these thoughts scare me, the realisation that your brain is almost planning of to off yourself, when deep down you know you don't want to die!

Does this make sense to anyone? Or am I rambling on with sleep deprived nonsense?",suicide

I've written many texts that were meant to be posted but never did.
Telling my own stories felt meaningless, knowing it won't do any good or bad.
I was never a good listener.

For the past three years I've been contemplating this.
I found notes that were written years ago about his very decision.
I found myself standing on top of a bridge, hanging a rope, covered in bags, and walking around among strangers just to feel something.

In two weeks I have a chance to travel far away from where I am.
to a place where no one knows my name.
I'll have to make a decision if I want to come back form there or stay there forever.

maybe I'll see something over there and start a new life?
or maybe I'll end it all

200716,"In 24 hours exactly I will end itThis is rather long so if you don't read this I'll understand but if you do I'll cut it down to the last 5 months or so. I'm suffering threw end stage liver disease. Got diagnosed with it years ago but only recently found out awhile ago that its ireversiable now and terminal and im going to need a liver transplant. Sadly I don't qualify for one as I need to be sober for 6 months I guess the donor programs have this time set to determine if you'll relapse or not. Makes sense, only so many donor organs to go around and they wouldn't want it going to someone who would mistreat the organ. I'm garbage I wouldn't deserve one anyway. I've pushed everyone away after hearing this news, specially my lovely girlfriend Margaret. We met a year ago, only started dating at the beginning of the year. We worked at pizza hut, total shit job by the way STAY THE FUCK AWAY. People their though were actually amazing made some life long friends their. Well not that I have much of a life left anyway. I pushed her away along with everyone else though, learning id be dieing has really taken a toll on me lately. I've been suicidal before hospitalized and thrown into that oh so precious psyc ward more times then I can count. Had counseling for ten years graduated a bit ago so I'm no stranger to the thought of death or dying or wanting to die at all. But theirs just something about knowing you have no choice in the matter? Knowing that it's coming, and due to reasons out of your control you really can't stop it. It's scary, INSANLY scary. Ever since I've found out, I've been so serious and gloomy and just emotionly tired to everything. It took a toll on me and Margarets relationship, I couldn't tell her seeing as she recently lost her grandfather when i had found out. It was not the appropriate time to tell her she was going to lose someone else also. And then another one of her grandparents was in the hospital so again couldn't muster the strength to break her heart. I kind of realized it was to late. After she graduates high school its off to the Navy for her, I can't burden her with such a thing before boot camp which I can only imagine is pure stress for 8 weeks toppled with the emotional bagage of a sick and dying boyfriend that can go at anytime. I couldn't ruin her dream job, so I pushed her away also and drove her away. When we broke up i said unbearable things that were so far from the truth when I look at the texts I wonder if i even wrote them. I don't actually,  since the liver cant file the toxins in my blood I'm starting to have brain damage. Im starting to have really bad memory problems practically bordering amnesia at this point. Yesterday I looked at the texts and was in complete shock of what i said to her I couldn't move. In my mind though the emotional hurt of a breakup compared nothing to watching someone you love slowly get sicker and die. What if I passed while she was at boot camp? It made sense, at least at the time. Now I can't even begin to understand why I just didn't tell her. But still, I didn't want to be a burden to her. I was afraid she would leave also. Now all I have is regret for making her do so. At this point, my condition will only get worse. And at best i got another month or so till I'm in a hospital counting my days away. Either way I'll be dead, this isn't a cry for help and theirs no talking me out of this. I've done enough research to know that theirs hardly any painless ways to go. So I've been taking my dad's blood thinners got my hands on a scalpel and know exactly where my radial artery is. I'm not afraid of the pain, I'm not even afraid of death anymore. I'm just afraid of tomorrow, and honestly I can't bare to live with the mistakes I made. And seeing as im going to die anyway. I'm only prolonging the inevitable, so TMR I'll clean my room try and tie up some lose ends. Tonight I'll write up suicide notes for people close to me including Maggie. Send them out, go over to Maggie's deliver her hers, and go into the forest behind her house. We would take nature walks their and the sound of the water in the stream is absolutely delightful. I imagine it being a more peaceful way of going then in some hospital bed. I'll end it their in the middle of the night painful for a bit sure, but eventually I'll go unconscious and I'm sure no one will find me for hours so I'll be long gone before then. I really don't know what happens after death, my fantasy is that we just restart our lives but contain the memories of it. Kind of like restarting a video game you've already beaten? Sure very highly doubt it but still, i can hope because God are their things I'd change. And I would definitely do everything I could to be with Maggie. Yeah yeah yeah I don't care... She was the one. I'm positive of it. Anyway I just wanted my thoughts to be out their before I go. Thank you for reading this if you have. I wish you all the best in your lives.

I don’t have any type of future ahead of myself except for sadness and a lonely path that I don’t want to take anymore. A couple thing I’ve been thinking about are if I could do anything I wanted before I leave this world what would it be. A couple things I’ve thought of are going somewhere that I’ve always wanted to see/do or doing something really great for one person to give them a chance at a happier life but I’m open to ideas if anyone has any. I don’t know anyone who’s learned they will die and what choices they made in the end to do with themselves. The other thing I’ve been contemplating is when that last milia second arrives will there be pain and nothingness kind of like when they put you down for surgery or will you feel that intense surge of pain (gunshot is what I’m thinking)? Again I don’t know anyone who’s had a near death experience and lived to say what happened in that last split second. I know people might say I have my whole life ahead of me and things will change but the sad truth is it will never change for me. I’ve been pretty unhappy my whole life and took a lot of wrong turns and I did have a lot of good moments but nothing substantial. Where I’m at now is the lowest and worse it’s ever been for me. I can really see why my ex left me after so long together. I’m going nowhere but down and I have this persistent sadness I carry with me everyday of my life. I guess having her in my life gave me brief glimpses of happiness but now it’s literally depression, isolation and hopelessness 24/7 365. The only positive thing about this is a couple people will get life saving donations and in my mind that’s at least one good thing after I leave this all behind me. It’s really scary actually thinking about doing this but I know in the end this is what’s suppose to happen. I got my fortune read along time ago and she told me I would see 40 and I really didn’t believe her at the time but damn she was right on.

(Obviously) I am going to ignore the “positive” things about me and only focus on the things that make me want to remove myself from this world. I say “this world”, but really we only get one life. I don’t want to start over, because there is no starting over. We get what we get, but I think that I’m too weak and pathetic a person to improve for the better. 5’11” (and a half that I sometimes round to 6’ to make myself feel better) and sometimes 160 pounds. I fluctuate between 155-160 but usually I’m below. That’s skinny as fucking shit. Basically skin and bone. I look at my wrists and I fucking recoil in disgust because I can see my individual wrist bones. Along with that, I am either extremely shy or don’t like people. Either way, I wish that I would interact with others more. What I “want” and what I “wish I wanted” are two different things. This is an incoherent mess, because (what I think is) luckily, I’m drunk. But when I’m drunk, I just spill my mind’s thoughts. This is kind of good, but kind of bad. I can’t talk like this while sober. This’ll be the end of this post because I have to piss.

Yeah, I am suicidal, but this post isn’t saying that I’ll shoot myself in the head or choke for a couple minutes by hanging myself. If I banged myself, I would make sure that it snapped my neck instantly. I’m a (former state, wow, I’ve fallen pretty far) swimmer, so I know how scary the feeling of suffocating is. If I am going to kill myself, I’ll make it instant. Either jumping off a cliff, shooting my self, or having enough height while hanging myself to instantly snap my neck.

I told him I wouldn't leave his house unless he called the police. Which was crazy to say.

So I yelled and said if he really wanted me gone I'll disappear forever and I ran upstairs to the kitchen as he chased me down. I wanted to grab a knife and stab myself in the stomach but I didn't even get that far to grab onto anything. I ran downstairs and tried to take some medicine but he took it away. He called his roommate downstairs and they called the police on me. I cried on the floor as he pinned me down and said ""so what? Now ur gonna say that I hit you?"" And I was shocked that he would use my past to make me feel something bad. The police suggested I go into the hospital a block away. I knew I wasn't okay so I did. I spent three days in a ward. Thinking how stupid this all was. But I can't forget how he didn't bother to support me through all of this. Two weeks later I had a miscarriage.

Begins the cycle of ideation
No mystery to what's on my mind
Once more I come up against suicide
I've made a way for it to be fun
Desire twisted toward being undone
Dagger plunged into my heart, a thrilling ride
My soul released from this body, a phoenix soaring into the sky
And so I'd fly into a new universe, a new life
Quantum Immorality would be on my side
The only thing that curbs this great appeal
Is something I chose a long time ago; an ideal
The siren song of death is allowed to be enticing
Its experience is allowed to be exciting
A thrilling adventure it's allowed to be
But it's the very last one that I'll see
Life is full of adventure, death is but one
So I will live to the fullest before I take that plunge
I love how much I grow when I overcome strife
So death must fucking earn my breath by taking me alive
Just because death offers the thrill I seek
Doesn't mean another victim I must be
Suicide is a desire that only lasts for a moment
So again I save my life using the ideal I've chosen",suicide
200837,"I don't feel like I have even a hypothetical chance to improve my existenceHello, people!
I am now at a point of life where I am completely stuck. 
I am 23, currently doing my master studies. 
Apparently, my life looks decent from the outside. But in reality, it is hell. I am at a point where I do not identify myself with being a person anymore. I just feel like I am nothing, just a rotting body with no feelings and perspectives that things will improve even in theory.
 I have struggled with an eating disorder since I was 16. Tried to get help from several medical institutions, psychologists, pills, etc. But it only gets worse with time. In last 2 years it has been a living hell. I cannot deal with it any longer. On top of that, I am also bipolar. Which does not help when I try to control myself. I basically cannot. 
I do not care how I look. I do not want to be pretty and thin. I just want to be productive and useful, because it makes me feel good. 
The problem is that I only can focus on studying and living life in general when I can restrict. But I cannot anymore as now my eating disorder took the form of BED (before it was anorexia, then ednos, then anorexia again, the couple of bulimic months when I inhaled a spoon and now BED for a couple years). I am not thin anymore. I do not care for that. But I feel worthless when I am constantly thinking about stuffing myself and doing that. This makes me unproductive. I sincerely try to care about my studies and am pretty good at forcing myself to do it. But in reality, it will not go well. It got worse in last 2 moths. Before that, even with constant internal struggle, I was passionate about learning stuff. But now it became a chore. Everything became a chore. Even washing my hair and basic hygiene. I don't go out. My friends do not understand me because I cannot formulate what I feel accurately. Even now as I am typing, I realize that it all sound basic and cheesy, like ""put yourself together, woman, children in Africa are starving and you only care about your stupid problem you invented"". But believe me, it is impossible to live like that, when you don't identify yourself not only with being a young woman but even with being a person. I constantly feel like I am somekind of a cartoon character which is pleasant to be around (I am nice to people and ready to help them if they ask and have good sense of humor) but not really a person with a full life. I have goals, I want to have a good carreer and be able to support my parents, but the necessity for that is to be able to control my eating habits. I never wished and feel stupid that such a basic thing controls my life. But in reality it does, I just have to accept it and minimize the suffering while trying to function. I just do not how to get back in control. Tried everything, it just does not work. I got out of patience and tried to commit suicide 2 times over the last 3 weeks. Magically, it did not work '(the car stopped and I just got scratches and bruises on my head and arms and the second time I just passed out for 1.5 days after taking an overdose of pills and woke up in a bunch of vomit, sorry for details). So yes. Don't know what now

200860,"this hurts and keeps repeatingI keep going in the same mental loop. I'm depressed, then suicidal, then I indulge in hope over something I'm used to accepting won't come true, I feel comforted, loved, safe, and then I accept it is not real, and then I feel depressed again, and an inch closer to suicide. 

My therapist says that I am choosing to not leave this cycle. I have tried. For many years. And this time it just feels stamped into my mind, and like, I can't change it, no matter how I try. 

I put up mental barriers, I forbid myself from giving in, I remind myself that it is a downward spiral, and sometimes this works. But not always. Sometimes something random triggers me into having hope. And then I fall back in again. 

I don't know how, and just, simple statements and decisions and acceptances don't work. They are as meaningless as gibberish to me. They don't affect my feelings. Even realizing that it just gets worse, every cycle, for diminishing returns on feeling slightly better. 

Otherwise, I feel, I don't know. empty. sad. without hope. unable to connect to anyone actually in my life. lacking the ability to keep my mind in the present, and not on the imaginary. 

I feel so broken, and I feel like fixing this would either require abrupt, intense pain - or just, so much more energy than I have left in me, that, when I'm at a low, I just want to try to die. I can't stand it, and the general advice I get is to just choose to change. I've tried. It either hurts too much or takes too much out of me. I'm stuck sinking in misery. 

A family member just came by, to ask me to spend time with them. I hate myself sometimes. I feel so sad. I feel like a terrible person. I feel like I'm just not mentally here with my family. My emotions are stuck in the past, and I just, I can't move on. I can't accept. I can't even begin to try without instantly wishing for death. My mind is just cemented into this pattern. I can't fix it and I can't expect anyone or anything to fix it for me, anything or anyone to help. 

I feel like I die more and more every day. And it hurts. In ways I just, can't express. Can't communicate. Can't find peace or acceptance with. 

This sensation, this whole pattern, over and over and over, makes me want to commit suicide. It makes me feel like that is my only choice I can make to actually free myself from this pain. And I feel like a terrible person for choosing that. For not wanting to feel like this anymore. 

I don't know. I keep coming on here just to vent to someone that doesn't know me enough to be hurt by my death. I just want someone to talk to until I decide when and how I'll die. I'm so lonely on top of all these feelings, and they are so taboo that I don't have anyone to let them out to in entirety, without being further hurt in order to protect me momentarily from myself. I just wind up making tiny choices instead, that put me at greater risk to die. 

Maybe that's a dramatic way of saying I pick unhealthy things to do. When I pick those things I do think 'I hope this kills me'. Now I just hope I find something to kill me quickly. Dying slowly alone is miserable and awful and terribly lonely. It is excruciatingly painful. I just don't want to be alone anymore, even if only for a few more days.

Look, I am just about to head into grade 11 and I am stressed out of my mind right now.  
Grade 11... just two more years left until I graduate and have to start applying to universities and also have to worry about work/income in the future. It feels so close and its terrifying.  


I thought I would be fine but as the days come closer and closer, it just becomes even more scary. Grades become super important in these next years, same with volunteering and you have to manage all that to make yourself look good to universities (Over here in Canada, supposedly Universities like volunteering a lot). Of course learning to manage it is a good experince for the future but during the present its the worst. I have a feeling stress will not be coming down these two years and I will just be having a mental warfare this entire time.  


It's not like I am doing bad in school, I have had usually most A's with B's but the thing is, I chose not to do Internation Bacceleraute program now after doing two years of Pre-IB. I dont think I am someone who can deal with that stress but now I know that for students outside of IB have to get like a 95% average in school to go to one of the good Uni's in Canada (according to my counselours) and that is super stressful.  


On top of that, this year we had a certain major event that lasted for many months. That event completely messed up the school year for us too. We had online education for like 5 months and it wasn't exactly the best. We didn't learn a whole lot and its much harder to retain that information for me. The fact of the matter is that did not help me remember what I learned last year and now coming this year into grade 11 its still unstable. Supposedly its planned until a vaccine is out and we can acquire it, we will only have two days of in-class learning. The rest of it being remote. How will that effect our education and what we can learn. How will that effect our ability on final exams. How will it effect our chances at university. Honestly speaking, online learning was quite easy last year but that was not a good thing. What about grade 12 where we will most likely be having normal school again. If the previous years, the education was too easy then how will it effect our learning for the grade 12 which is our final chance at getting a good grade.

200881,"I feel like suicide is inevitable. Is there anything I can do to fix my life?I'm 27 and trapped in a shitty job in a shitty city, partly due to my family and partly due to the fact that I was unable to pass job interviews while I was unemployed.

My dad is manipulative and got me a car seemingly so he could use it as leverage on me. If I'm not doing what he wants, he just reminds me he's sacrificing everything to make payments on the car for me. I was going to just give it back, but the transmission broke while I was going to a job interview out of state, and I was on the hook for the entire cost since he didn't want to pay for it.

He is very emotionally invested in the job he got me since he has friends there. I need to give 110% while he constantly polices me or he's going to look bad.

My problem is always going to be earning enough acceptance from other people to make money. I can live with being alone and single forever, but I can't live with doing a shitty job on top of that. I'd rather just kill myself than be stuck doing something horrible just to perpetuate a meaningless existence.

I've just taken off in the past on long road trips. If I do that now, I can expect to have the police called on me for something. My dad claimed someone stole my old car and took me hostage (all bs) and then when the police stopped me over that, they found a frivolous reason to give me a $100 ticket.

200892,"FatalisticI've been trying to write this all day and I keep getting sidetracked.  I went to see a friend.  I thought about eating, but I still haven't really been able to bring myself to do it.  I've been drinking Red Bull and smoking all day instead.  I don't think I ate yesterday either.  That fact is supposed to be important, somehow, but we'll get to it later.

I went to the gym and pushed myself a little too hard.  I can't really lift my arms right now.  I dropped my wallet three times at the convenience store trying to buy another pack of smokes.  My hands are shaking right now.  After all this it's still a struggle to type.  I'm fucking wired.  I feel as though I'm one little slip away from smashing the keyboard to bits with my fists instead of trying to elicit something meaningful from this strange state I'm in.

This is already longer than it should be.  I was thinking about writing this earlier and actually convinced myself that it wouldn't collapse into some banal stream of consciousness nonsense loosely connected by the recurring theme of imminent self harm.  So much for that.

The point is that I've put together a list of little tricks to keep myself from backsliding into the state of mind that I'm in right now.  Seeing friends, meditating, running, lifting weights, driving around and listening to angry music and screaming until my voice breaks.  It's been working for a while now.  Maybe some of you people would be proud.

Thing is, the list of things which *must* be done to keep this kind of thing from happening keeps getting longer.  Maybe most people who decide to be proactive don't realize that.  Maybe it doesn't happen to them at all.  It's happening to me.  I have to work harder, I have to keep going, I have to stay creative and limber and quick on my feet to stay on top of this thing.  I thought I'd reach some sort of breaking point and just be able to move past it eventually, you know?  I haven't, though, and now I'm only exhausted.  

Fatalistic.  I like the sound of it, and if you've read the recent posts over in /r/suicidology, you're probably familiar with this category.  It's the one for people who see patterns in life and feel trapped by them.  I don't necessarily feel that this sums my plight up beautifully, but I certainly empathize and identify with the prospect.  It's as good as any other, I suppose.

A person like me identifies patterns, assigns some sort of arbitrary meaning to them which supersedes normal understanding and uses them to perpetuate destructive tendencies.  Personally, for me, it's a matter of creating the illusion of control over some fundamental part of life as a means of compensating for everything I cannot bend to my will.  Not eating, for example.  I can choose to not eat.  I can justify it with just about anything, too.  Call it penance for the sin of being born into a situation where food is plentiful for everyone while children in third world countries starve in ditches.  Whatever.  It doesn't really matter.  The core of it is that the physical feeling of emptiness is satisfying when it mirrors the less tangible, more abstract state of psychological desolation.

I feel like I'm focusing too much on one aspect of this.  Take the example above and apply it to most aspects of life.  Careers, relationships, creative pursuits, friendships, a sense of belonging, of hope, of feeling that our worldly endeavors will ultimately yield something useful or comforting or fulfilling.  Whatever it is which helps a person foster that sort of illusion is missing within me.  I feel as though catastrophic failure is far more likely than even a small degree of success in just about every situation, and anyone who fails to understand that is only fooling themselves.  

There's been a lot of failure in my life lately.  I'm not exactly in the proper state to even begin to describe each one of those failures in detail, but they're there.  It's maddening.  It doesn't just make me angry;  it fills me with a deep, seething hatred for myself and everyone around me.  It makes me want to do something incredibly irrational.  It makes me wonder how I ever made it this far in the first place.

So there it is, in a nutshell.  Tell me to get help.  Tell me to go to therapy or take medication.  Tell me I'm beautiful and unique and I'm strong enough or wise enough to make it through this.  

Lie to me.

200903,"I don't feel like I DESERVE to be aliveHopefully some of you can relate. I don't know if anyone even cares enough to read this, but I'm on my last leg today. 

Ever since I can remember, I've felt like it was in my cards to kill myself. Growing up, I was fat, ugly, and had an issue with excessive crying, bursting out into tears in class since I was in preschool. It never went away. I would have to be removed from elementary school constantly because I would just BURST out crying. Just always fantasizing about death and how I didn't deserve to be alive. My dad was pretty mean and hit me sometimes, but it was mostly yelling and swearing at me, never rape or anything ridiculously bad. 

When he hit me, I felt like I deserved it, because I was a ""bad"" kid for always crying in school and freaking out. Turns out the freaking out and crying was because I had OCD as an actual child, which is fairly rare. If I couldn't count in order or if I had an intrusive thought about contamination or God smiting me, I would cry. Had this occurred in adulthood, maybe I could have handled it with more grace, but when you're 7 and you ""hear God tell you in your head that you have tapeworms,"" what are you supposed to do but have a panic attack?

My parents refused treatment for me because they said ""I would grow out of it."" This ostracized me at school to the point of other girls and boys calling me ""psycho."" I would wash my hands in the bathroom for 35 minutes and get in trouble for it, then get dragged back into the middle school classroom, crying. And, obviously, middle school girls + weird girl with bleeding hands= extreme bullying for me. 

This identity has never left me. I now feel like the crazy girl, and I eventually believed them when they said I should kill myself. I still feel like I am a freak. I used to do the whole shebang, the twitching face, the opening and closing the classroom door... I was a fucking freak and I would have been freaked out, too. My whole childhood, gone. I never had a childhood. I'm only going to live once, so now that the best years of my life are nothing, why keep living?

I never had a single friend growing up. Not one. My only friend was food, or my mom. This is pathetic. I would take it out on my mom (telling her I wished she was dead, calling her horrific swears, saying I wished I was aborted, threatening to kill myself to make her afraid as a kid). I didn't KNOW why I was so pissed at her... but in retrospect, I guess I was pissed because she would not help me... she just kept me her helpless, psychotic baby who still needed reassurance and help getting dressed in the morning. A part of me thinks she liked it... I was so mentally ill in 7th grade, I was afraid to touch my clothes because of ""germs on them."" My mother had to dress me when I was 12 years old. Still, no therapy allowed. Every day felt like fucking war. I lost 20 lbs from anxiety, I was too afraid to eat because I thought ""there were aliens in my food."" OCD as a kid SUCKS, because you don't have a great grip on reality to begin with...

This hurts me and keeps me up at night to this day, because my mother is actually the sweetest person alive. She NEVER hurt me, she just prevented me from getting treatment because she lives in complete denial of anything threatening. She even pretends my sister isn't gay because she thinks she can will things away. I feel bad for her cause I wonder if it is MY fault she became this way. Maybe if she didn't have a psycho cunt daughter with OCD who told her she hated her everyday, she wouldn't have turned to denial so often. What if I made HER crazy, too? I feel like a curse, and my dad called me that a lot as a kid, he also called me a fat cunt, etc. He told me ""he tried to motivate me.""

That clearly didn't work for my depression, because I'm still here, alone on a Friday night, posting to Reddit for help that I probably won't get. People will probably skim this, say TLDR, and move on. Because I'm fucking worthless. And I know it. You guys don't actually care about me.

I am here tonight because I feel like there is literally no hope for me. I have tried therapy, meds, etc. I am now 23 years old. I just graduated college. I made NO FRIENDS in college, because my OCD resurfaced in the form of a severe eating disorder. I lost 100 lbs and ended up 68 lbs at age 19. I almost died, and nobody at my school wanted to be seen with me because I was so disgusting and thin (the cruel irony when I grew up fat). Still, I got a 4.0 in college. I moved out at age 20 and got a job in a really cool place. I landed a near impossible job. I don't want to get into the specifics for confidentiality purposes, but I work at a studio as a filmmaker. 

When I tell people my life story, they judge me. Nobody ever looked at me the same after I made my college thesis film about having depression. I have several people in my alumni association telling everyone ""she's crazy."" It does more than hurt my feelings, it makes me want to fucking kill myself. I finally got this dream job, and here these assholes in the alumni association are, ruining my chance to start fresh and excel. I never hurt anyone. All I did was have a mental illness. And yet they want to ruin me. I don't feel like I can succeed at my new job now, since some of the alumni work at the same studio. If I am such a burden to my mom and dad, if I can't control my weight or eating now, why am I alive? ",suicide
200905,"Suicidal but not depressed?Female, age 19, college student.

Almost my entire life I’ve struggled with mental health issues. Anxiety, severe depression, anorexia, ADHD, and dermatillomania (OCD). When I was in my early-mid teen years, I self harmed almost every single day and I attempted suicide 5 times in total. Self harm and suicide became my obsession bad then, and I was so extremely depressed for a 3 year period that I barely remember anything from it. Eventually, my mom found out about how serious my mental health issues were, so I was fortunate enough to start seeing a therapist and to go on anti-depressants and ADHD meds. It took a couple of years, but eventually after a max-dose of Zoloft, frequent therapy visits and supportive friends/family, I started to recover. I stopped self harming and I stopped thinking about suicide so much. I became happy again, and the past 2 years were some of the best years of my life.

However, my mental health has taken a turn in an odd way. I’m currently in college, and I love my roommates, friends, classes, and my school. But recently I’ve been starting to fantasize about suicide and self harm again, which is weird because overall, I’m not NEARLY as depressed as I used to be. I relapsed again (cutting) after 2 years and it’s become my drug again. Whenever my roommates are gone, I seriously consider hanging myself in the shower or overdosing on pills. But this seriously makes no sense to me... I’m STILL on the max dose of Zoloft, and my life is overall so good and I should be so happy! I don’t even feel depressed, I just feel numb and “meh” all the time. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, and my dark thoughts are scaring me.

I’m the kind of person who NEEDS to find explanations for everything, and I’m trying to figure out why I could be feeling this way. Here are my ideas.

1. My body has gotten too used to my Zoloft (I’ve been on it for 5 years, max dose for 3.5 or so) and they are therefore slowly starting to not work.
2. I recently started drinking a little bit (like, 3 times in my life total) and after drinking I did get super depressed... Could that be the root of my problem?
3. I’m not as athletic or healthy as I used to be in high school? I used to swim for the swim team 16 hours per week, and now I don’t even have time (or motivation) to work out 2 hours per week.

I’m lost and confused. If anyone could help me to try to figure my shit out I would really appreciate it. Am I weird for feeling this way? Has anybody else felt this way? Does anyone know any other reasons that could explain why I’m feeling this way? Feel free to ask me any follow up questions and please share your own experiences. I feel so stupid for feeling so down when I shouldn’t be.

I made one serious attempt at suicide when I was 26. After being diagnosed and put on Prozac, things started to change. I put myself through Law School, and I practiced law for a number of years. But even 15 or 20 years ago, I told people that I didn't want to live past my 40s because I am absolutely terrified about getting old. I thought maybe the terror and panic would lessen over time, but it has gotten worse. None of my friends are my age and I don't fit in with my generation. All of my friends are 15 or 20 years younger than me, I think because I started really living so late. I just moved so I don't see my friends anymore,  but even before that, I was never 100% a part of the group because of my age. I am divorced and have no children. Nobody is relying on me for financial support. Right now, things are about as good as they will ever get. I have this amazing job I just got a few months ago. For what will probably be the last time, an incredibly cute 20 year old girl has a thing for me. I have aged well, but I will definitely become invisible in a very short time. I have come to terms with some of my deeper secrets that haunted me when I was young, and when I disclosed the secrets to my closest friends, they showed complete and total acceptance. I have been thinking more and more about suicide the last few weeks. I always wanted children and now there is no real chance for that. I know I can't date much younger women, but the women my age who like me don't hold any attraction for me. This means that I will just keep getting older and be forever alone. I know this would devastate my parents and my siblings, but I don't think that is enough to keep me here. This isn't just about what's happening in my life. I have this absolute phobia about getting older that other people just can't have, or nobody would be getting older.

I feel bad having to create a fake account just to let this out and dumping all this on you guys but I really need help. Im a 19 year old college student from Texas and my life has been absolutely shit the past few months. everything is a mess and nothing is going right in college I just failed my first class and my gpa dropped from a 3.0 to a 2.6 and I lost my scholarship and I cant afford the school im currently enrolled in so im thinking about transferring to a community college until I can get another scholarship. and a close friend of mines had given me 1k to hold for her but I had bills and rent to pay so I used the money and I thought I would have enough Time to pay her back but I worked a minimum wage job and not to mention I recently lost my job because the restaurant I worked at got closed and I cant find another job. and one of my closes friends from childhood was shot and killed a few weeks ago and my friends mom died 4 days ago and my aunt committed suicide about 3 month ago. I cant handle death so for everyone so close to me to die left and right is driving me to the edge. also my only friends aren't talking to me because yesterday I fell in a really depressive episode while we were out and they told me that I need to separate my personal problems from how I treat others and that I should have snapped out of it and socialize again instead of distanced myself. so not only am I not enrolled in a school yet, I'm thousands in debts because I toke out loans to pay for my car, I owe my friend a grand, everyone is dying, theres tooo much going on for me to handle my depression and anxiety is killing me, I can't and won't burden my family with this because they're going through enough hardship already. lastly with all this going on I went for a drive and I don't know how but my head wasn't there and I zoned out behind the wheel and hit a parked car I snapped back to reality and I was soo scared I checked the other car and it was fine but my car is messed up really bad and I drove off I didn't know what to do because Im driving without insurance. im a shiity human being who doesn't deserve to live but I swear months prier I was a happy full of joy and love teenager but like I haven't even been 19 for an entire month yet and I want to end my life so I guess this is like a suicide note my friends and family will never find but thank you for listening and reading through the bullshit and typos. I want to overcome this but I just cant I want to end it because I have never hit this rock bottom before but I also want to live because I have 6 siblings 18,16,14,11,9 and 2 months old. I have tried to commit suicide in the past when I was 17 it was bloody and horrific but I lived and seeing my friends and family broken hurt me. I really want help and to fight this but I don't know if you have any similar stories or advice please comment I need something to keep me afloat.",suicide
200940,"Strange, isn’t it?The thing that finally does you in, isn’t the fact that both siblings have committed suicide since 2015. Not that your pedo uncle got away with it and passed the polygraph my  *own* father gave to him even though you’re father’s favorite-well, not after **that**. Not that you were then raised by an egg donor who has malignant narcissistic personality disorder and 51 years later still trying to figure out how to fucking make her love you. Instead  repeatedly donor tells me things that cut to the bone and hurt like a child would. Even after 35 fucking years of therapy for fucks sake! 
Or that I lost my kids when I became homeless due to something that never would’ve come out that way should I have been able to afford legal counsel. 

The more I write, the more I’m just thinking wtf why am **I** the one who hasn’t offed herself yet?


I asked for help with food from one of the charity places here. The first time I wrote it, (they always ask how you got to the point of needing their help, so I included some of the things but also included that I’d been alone every holiday for the past two decades...well the mod messaged me, told me I sounded entitled and manipulative. I couldn’t believe what I was reading. Part of my egg donor’s torture was letting me go hungry cause she couldn’t stand to look at me so instead of dinner was sent to bed.  If anything that ended up 1) making me extremely grateful whenever someone IS/WAS nice to me, oh fuck writing everything out...the point is I grew up thinking I wasn’t worth any help, much less feel like anything is owed to me. I was TERRIFIED of asking for help. 

Eventually this mod did help me by giving me pointers to write it without “guilting people into it” which I had absolutely no clue I might have been doing that until I brought it up in therapy yesterday. She explained as a child, when you’re constantly denied basic needs such as food, safety, nurture, that you learn to get needs met in ways that could possibly be manipulative, but it wasn’t like a greedy meiser saying hmmmm what can I get my hands on today?

No. I’d not only been suicidal off and on throughout the holidays, but stupidly did the secret Santa exchange because I NEEDED TO FEEL PART OF SOMETHING, but most of all a tiny amount of joy after driving up and down the highway several times trying to let the wheel go to run into the pillars. Because I should’ve used that 20 dollars for food I was shamed also, but I didn’t do it thinking I’d run out of money. I have not ONE soul in the universe that gives one shit about me and I needed some kind of kindness somehow. But I didn’t get drunk like my egg donor did every fucking day, didn’t do drugs or anything else unhealthy. But I am very sensitive to feeling hungry, AND I’m on psychiatric medication that creates an insatiable appetite therefore I eat a lot of rice and other cheap yet unhealthy things because that’s how the system works and have a long history of food being withheld throughout childhood that I was an emotional wreck...

So fine. I got help. 

Then Christmas night comes. No food whatsoever. Period. Nada. Completely alone again, feeling the death twinge, but instead I did again, what my therapist has been trying to teach me for the past seven years. I had initially gone to the food pantry sub and got a lot of help, but it would take a couple days for anything to show up...so on Christmas night, I went to the assistance place here just asking for a little help to somehow find something open so I could eat, I was SO very hungry, especially given the few meds I’m on that increase hunger but also my issues with having food withheld from me *often* growing up.  I again didn’t go there to get MORE free food cause I’m an entitled scum like they pretty much insinuated after downvoted me to nothing, didn’t bother to pm me and explain why I shouldn’t be doing it, and someone did end up helping me and I was able to get some Chinese food....

So they have this acts of greed sub they talk in naming all the scammers to watch out for and me going into the two assistance subs was listed. 

Before I saw mine, I saw some others that were truly horrendously greedy and many even possibly pathological. So many were so bad I felt embarrassment for them. 

THen like I said....instead of being kind adults to me and messaging me and letting me know that I was pushing it by asking a second time for just ANYTHING I was just so hungry, neighbors’ food smells were driving me crazy because I live in a high rise and you can smell anything the others are cooking...they wrote about me like I’m the worthless scum I already was feeling just for the fact that I needed to ask for help, and having 51 years being told I’m not worth anyone’s help. Then in my initial thank you post, one of the mod changed it to go from a simple thank you, to saying IM GONNA GO GET A GIANT PIZZA NOW AND EVEN GO BUY SOMETHING FROM MY AMAZON LIST THAT SOMEONE DIDNT GET ME! The SHAME I am feeling after seeing that now knowing people really think that of me now when I was NOT. DOING. ANYTHING. DEVIOUS.  When the Christmas post was getting downvoted I asked....I probably really did do something wrong, but my only motivation posting that was to alleviate very PAINFUL hunger that was bringing up a huge amount of childhood trauma, and the loneliness was intensifying it, but when I asked why I was being downvoted someone from there, instead of explaining, said ohhh it’s just trolls don’t worry about them! At first I believed him and thanked him for the reassurance. I also pm’d him to thank him again. Then he started saying strange things that I just realized also this morning were just headgames he was playing with me?? Why? Why was all of this stuff done in public forums to shame me after the enormous shame I was already feeling? I know that this mod was playing games with me because now he has blocked me. The last thing he sent me was this. You’re not really you when you’re hangry are you? I replied I don’t know what that word means, next thing I knew he’d blocked me. 

This whole thing was terrifying to do in the first place, and my worst fears...NIGHTMARES came to fruition instead.  Couldn’t they have just said we prefer you post to only one assistance subreddit within x amount of time instead of fucking with someone seriously mentally ill and possibly get the worst outcome of that??

I guess I’m writing this all out beforehand. I’m not swearing I’m going to speed over the highway to run into the pillars. I’ve been misunderstood for so many things in life and this was a huge one because on my side I know I was starving and in survival mode and doing something my therapist was trying to help me with for years and now ....shame. So much shame that I don’t know if I can even continue. I had so many wonderful people help me the day or two prior, I actually felt loved for the first time. 

Now I realize that those that did help, were who I wish I could be, but being on disability, the most I can do is continue to buy yarn and make hats, scarves, and blankets all year long for when winter comes and give them out to the homeless throughout my city. 

But none of that even matters anymore. This shame and humiliation and worthlessness has become larger monster than anything I’ve dealt with.  It’s everything I’ve ever been told about myself only now it’s much worse because so many made fun and shamed me there.  They edited my POST and made me sound like a scamming PIG! I edited it back somewhat, but the buy a huge pizza part remains.

I have no fucking clue how the fuck she knew the fucking answer to that question. I don’t think the teacher has ever told us what C6H12O6 is, an if she has then I don’t fucking remember it. 

I *need* to improve my memory and overall academics. I *need* to become better than her, and I want to be recognised for that. 

I hate being called a gamer. I almost never play video games anymore, because I’ve learnt that it is better to spend time studying. People will *always* judge you on your past. If you try to hide it from them, thy will eventually find out. I don’t know why I hate it, but I do. Maybe it’s because I get no recognition for the effort I put in. Maybe it’s because it’s not true anymore.

Sometimes I honestly just feel like giving up. But I don’t. I know that giving up is just a waste of our precious time on this planet. That doesn’t change the fact that I feel worthless at times. Honestly all I want out of life is to be recognised for good things, and to be remembered after I die.

I'm at the end of the rope, I have no where left to turn. My life is spiraling further out of my control and I don't know how to fix it, or even if I can. Not a day has gone by in the past 10 years where I haven't considered taking my own life, whether with a firearm in my house or the large suspension bridge on my morning commute. I'm 26 years old, overweight, poor, health in rapid decline, and still living with my parents. Never dated, never had more than a handful of friends, never graduated high school and dropped out of college after a semester. My crowning achievement in life is a GED and a few flight school lessons I couldn't afford to continue.

I'm...not a normal person. I accept this. Whether it's caused by some mental illness or just my stubborn refusal to change I'll probably never know. However at this point I don't feel like there's any way to move forward. In fact, I've grown so detached from my life that most days I'm on autopilot, just going through the motions until I get home and can retreat into a fantasy world in my mind, in fact...I prefer that world to the real one almost 90% of the time and sometimes almost believe that death will take me there and away from this pain.

In fact I'm posting this from my work computer in the pathetic hope it'll throw some red-flags in IT and maybe my employer could offer some help(I work for one of the largest Healthcare companies in the US).

I had typed out a huge multi-paragraph essay on all the things in my life that were bothering me...and then deleted it. I don't feel they really are necessary here. Just know I want to seek help, but this is the only way I can effectively communicate. Speaking face to face with a therapist, if I could even afford one, is just something I don't think I could do. 

I just know that I can't take this much longer, I will eventually snap and end it all. The worst part of it all? I feel like most everything is my fault yet I'm powerless to change anything.

I’ve gone through all of it, all sorts of counselling I can name ten just off the top of my head.

And it was all cantered around “cognitive behavioural therapy”. 

And finally I’m on PTSD therapy but I’ve made zero progress in the four months that I’ve been there and every time I walk in I leave feeling like shit.
 We can’t even do the actual therapy part because we need to build trust and I’m in quotes “nowhere near where I need to be to be sent into what I’m trying to send you into”. My therapist claims if she tries to recall trauma to me I won’t be able to come out of the hole she’ll send me to.

She told me how it may take years for me to trust her and reconnect with my emotions. And at one point I cut off my emotions and disconnected so I could survive but now I need them back and. I can’t get them back.

Today’s been so bad, I want to kill myself and this year I’ve had 2 near attempts. But I can’t find a good way to kill myself.

The guns roared and sent the mud of the once green field high into the air. 

The muskets cracked and filled the air with smoke and dust.

In the middle of the this great battle marched a line of infantrymen towards their enemy.

In this line who marched straight on towards a certain death was Nikolai. He had been sent to Austria when he was just 16 to fight a foreign enemy beneath a foreign sky and for a foreign land.

But back then despite him not knowing the purpose of fighting for the Austrians it was warmer weather, more food and happier comrades. 

But now he was beneath a familiar sky in his home land, and it was cold. 

The dead autumn leaves laid on the ground. Now benath a familiar sky Nikolai and the regiment who once were like brothers would fight over who would get to be close to the fire at the end of a long days march.

&amp;#x200B;

He did not even know why he was marching anymore, at the beginning he had been fighting for honor and medals. But what does a feeling of pride and a bit of metal on your coat do when you don't have any legs or arms?

These thoughts were on Nikolais mind all the time, but he continued up the hill and towards the enemy. 

He and everyone else knew that if one were to die the person behind him would just take his place and the line would continue.

And still, the line marched on.

Suddenly Nikolai heard cannons roar from the hills top. He saw the blast and he felt the blast. But when he tried to march on his legs wouldn't move. The soldier who had once been behind him was now infront of him.

&amp;#x200B;

''But that can't be right''Thought Nikolai. ''I am not dead, I am alive, I can't be dead''. But all the same the line marched on. And no matter how much Nikolai shouted or walked, he made no sound and got not further.

But he couldn't give up, he didn't want to die. He didn't want to die in the cold, left on a field of mud.

He heard the cannons roar again, but this time faintly in the distance, the sound was soft and almost calming even though they were closer to him then they had ever been before. 

But this time they didn't fill Nikolai with fear as they had done at Smolensk when they were far away.

Neither did the faint cries of the men cut down by the canister shot fill him with a fear for his life as they did at Austerlitz. To him the sound of the small lead balls hitting the ground similar to the sound of a soft summers rain.

Now all those fears and pains were just a distant memory to Nikolai, something the held no meaning to him anymore.

And by the time the French soldiers marched down the hill and talked with joy of their victory and how bravely they had fought the Russians. Nikolai had completely forgotten about the war, about the cold wind and the brown and dead leaves.

I'm pretty sure i have a small degree of bipolar disorder for some days I feel like I can do anything and everything. But as of right now I want to die.

My family is kinda broke and my dad would close a big money deal, so if that works out Ill have to pull myself out of this dark place, at least ill be a worthless heir, I have that to look forward to. If it doesnt happen my dad could die, hes old mid 70s old, and this is his life work we are talking about, I pulled some weight on that deal, I think that is also triggering my anxiety. The uncertainty.

Im about to withdraw from the last class befoe getting my degree I just cant write an academic paper, ive failed 3 times already, maybe four times if i dont retire, and then i'd be expelled.  I had a semi-manic episode and wrote something very exciting, turns out its pseudo-scientific. Instead of working on that paper i waste my life on the internet and on TV i just cant deal with life. I wanted to be a lawyer so bad but now I just forgot why I started.  I've been putting my bjj belt around my neck, im really scared i might do it one day. I cant talk to my dad hes very old school and would be so disapoined, my mom does her best, but I resent her, shes a bit narcisistic and her attitudes helped me get to this place.  I mean she told me ""your dad is a bum he dreams of his big money deal and does nothing"" it scarred me. Also my dad was like the most interesting man in the world. My life is being depressed and getting drunk and making a fool of myself. My family is status obsessed, I drank that kool aid and now i realize im just a normal fellow. But man this depression is killing me.

I'm going to see a therapist today for alcohol abuse. Hopefully I'll get better and if all works out I'll give a shot to being happy. I kind of wanted to vent.

We are all going to die at some point anyways so why not just get it over with. Maybe I can validate my existence by making the time others around my have more enjoyable. That is my goal. Maybe I’ll feel better about myself. I’ve always liked to help others. However I think because of this people have taken advantage of this/taken this for granted. I have no one there for me. No one truly cares about it how I feel. No one knows how sad I am. I guess that’s my fault for not opening up to people. I just don’t feel comfortable I guess. I feel like no one would want to listen anyways. But I wish someone would. It hurts so bad to hold it in. I have so much pain inside. I’ve started to cry before I go to sleep more frequently. I think this is because I lay down in bed and reflect on life/ how my day went. And I usually do nothing every day. And I’ve achieved nothing in life so far.

201012,"Undesirable and untalentedI do not know if this post belongs here but I am so lost at this moment that I do not know what else to do. Please pardon my grammar mistakes, for I do not use English as often as I would like, and the length of my post, as there is so much to tell I do not know how to make it any shorter.

I feel like an utter failure, undesirable and untalented. I am 25, almost 26, struggling through a bachelor degree and working a miserable part time job. The job itself was once great, the team making you feel like a part of a family. Of course, the others made something out of themselves and graduated from their respective fields of study, leaving me as the old one among many new employees. Now, it feels divided, unprofessional, and I have problems with another employee who seem so overconfident in himself that he becomes blind to any other perspective than his own. 

As for university, I barely keep my scholarship by my mediocre results. Knowledge and quick wit were once my strong suit but I couldn’t find myself more lacking these past few years, as if my time out of school siphoned all my will and strength out of me. The struggle is constant and far from over, as I still have at least 2 years of study to do before I attempt to obtain a job only one in five get.

However, what burden me the most is both my lack of success with women and being a stranger to myself. I am not the kind of man who sought one night stands. I wanted to find someone who would share some interests with me and with values I would like. I know my dream woman doesn’t exist but that didn’t stop me from meeting some that I could see myself with. Unfortunately, I lack courage to ask a girl out when I should, and those rare times I manage to muster it, I get turned down or wait for an answer that never comes. What doesn’t help is that I am mostly socially inept and doesn’t know much about dating in itself. As for not knowing myself, I should rephrase it as not knowing what image I send to those around me. I know that I am not ugly, that I prefer tranquility, that my hobbies are far from those of most people (tabletop D&amp;D, boardgames, videogames and such), that I try to be as gentlemanly as possible despite my terrible shyness and that I would much rather have few friends that will always have my back than dozens whos I do not know more than two things about. What I do not know is if I send the image of a man-child or of an anti-social man. I also have a hard time to grasp the concept of self-confidence. On one hand, I fear to become overconfident, the thing I despise the most in this world, on the other, I am afraid that my lack of confidence will make me live a lonely life.

Now, a part of me want to just put an end to it, to stop feeling cold at night or feeling like I have to hide all my secrets and moments of weakness without ever sharing them. I want to feel a bit selfish one last time and just finally drop the whole burden once and for all. ",suicide

201024,"I feel like my entire existence is a burden and a failureThis might turn out to be a bit long so I'm sorry. 
I feel like I'm a burden to everyone, especially my family. I'm almost 30 and I haven't reached any of the goals I or my family set for myself. I depend on my Mom financially, I also live with her. On the side I work a shitty fast food job and I get embarrassed every time I have to talk about it or someone I know walks in, because I should've earned a degree and made something out of myself long ago and I haven't. I don't consider myself a stupid person, I just could never finish anything. It started in HS when I was diagnosed with depression, mainly because of watching my parents marriage go down the tubes and dealing with an emotionally and verbally abusive father who defined me by the grades I got. Coupled with the fact that I couldn't keep up in school due to my depression it made for a real shitty situation in which I was regularly told some pretty terrible shit that a child should never hear, especially from a parent. As a young adult I worked and I started school but never finished. As a result I don't think I've been truly happy for the last 8 or so years of my life because of this constant feeling of inadequacy.
I decided to go back to university a year ago and it actually made me happy and gave me purpose again. I was finally excited about something. Then, 2 months into the first semester in November of last year, my mom got a cancer diagnosis and everything went to shit again. I feel even worse for depending on her financially now. I go to therapy with her, try to console her whenever she is down (which happens a lot), and generally try to do things with her. I'm confronted with the sickness every single day of my life and see the effect chemo has on her which has taken a toll on me physically and emotionally. I get headaches every other day and my sleeping patterns are completely off, plus I feel anxious all the time. Combined with the fact that my uni is extremely competitive I feel overwhelmed and fear that I won't succeed and end up failing again at the only thing that could make me happy again and save me from feeling like such a burden. It would be hard under regular circumstances but in this situation it seems like it can't be done. I've really been putting in so much work over the past few months trying to take care of my mother the best I can and studying 6+ hours a day for weeks to prepare for exams. I've tried to talk to my parents about transferring to a less competitive university but that would mean not being able to commute and having to rent a room which is again more money that I don't have myself. My dad has made it clear that I won't get a single dime from him and my mom gets angry and lashes out at me when I bring it up, I know because she worries about her financial situation especially now that she's sick. Tonight she said I should probably just quit if I'm this lazy because after all I'd have to study at the other uni as well. I can't begin to explain how angry this made me because I literally studied my fucking ass off all the while taking care of her since November. I literally felt like breaking stuff and going off on her but I realized it's just resentment and I don't want to hurt her feelings at all. At the same time she is literally paying for my life and I feel like I don't have a right to be angry. I get anxious thinking about having to go back to school because I'm scared I won't pass and I want to transfer so badly...but if the money isn't there it's just not possible.

I don't know what to do. I feel like if I didn't exist everyone would have one less thing to worry about, especially money-wise. But I also know if I did something to myself it would destroy everyone. I feel trapped and hopeless and just want to vanish. It sounds stupid but sometimes I wish something horrible would happen to me out of nowhere so at least nobody could say that I did it myself. I don't know how to explain it but there's this feeling that I just don't belong on earth and am not supposed to be alive because I'm just not made for this.

I stopped cutting when I was 17, I’m 22 now and I just tried to do it again. The object wasn’t as sharp as it was back then so I only left two red ass lines across my forearm.



Some context is I essentially lie to myself every single day in order to stay sane. My parents still treat me like I’m a child, I work a shit job where I get treated like shit for minimum wage, I have absolutely zero friends, I’m short, I’m below average in the looks department.



What brought on this breakdown today is my father reminding me of why I first became depressed. Living in a household devoid of love and understanding. Like shit, is it too much to ask for a teeny bit of respect, I mean, for fucks sake I pay rent to them to live here and it’s only slightly cheaper then if I were to move out.



Why I don’t move out? I’m barely keeping my mind in tact as it is, I don’t even have a friend so I’d have to find someone looking for a roommate and hope to god they aren’t a complete shit.

I don't even know why I'm writing this. It's not like anyone cares.

Anyway, since Monday I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts, usually when I've got nothing to do. 

Like on the bus to/from college or waiting for something. I just have vivid thoughts and images of me jumping off a bridge or being hit by a car and dying. These thoughts have been happening quite a lot this week. 

I am incredibly depressed but not suicidal, so I have no idea why I'm having these thoughts.

I would then ditch my car somewhere people would expect to find it.  Then I would run to the local state park that has tons of woods.  I'd run until I was in the most secluded place of the park and sit down.  I imagine I would take one last look of the forest before I blow my brains out.

201058,"I’m thinking of killing myself tonight and I just wanted to know if I should leave a note or not. What do you think?For the past three hours I’ve been staring at the blank sheet of paper in front of me thinking of what to say other than how truly sorry I am. I want to leave something behind for my parents—an explanation of why tonight it my last night, a chance to tell them everything I’ve never been strong enough to tell them. I don’t want them to blame themselves. I just want them to be happy, for them to not have my death prevent them from moving on with their lives. I want my brother to know that I’m sorry for being difficult and putting a stain on our family. That I believe in him and I want nothing more than him to overcome the situation that my family is in. There’s also a part of me that wants people to understand that I’m doing this not as an act of revenge or cry of help. I don’t want to hurt anyone. This is for myself, for my own sanity. And here’s the thing I did try to get help. I was hospitalized, I took my medication, I went to both individual and group therapy, but god I just can’t seem to get rid of this feeling that this place is not my home. I want to tell everyone that I’ve felt more dead than alive for so long that suicide doesn’t seem all that bad anymore. It almost sounds peaceful. It’s almost beautiful in a sense. To lie in soft brown earth, with grasses waving above you, and listen to a symphony of silence. To forget time, to forgive life, and to simple just rest in peace. No more pain. No more worries. Just finally slumbering forever away, oblivious to the world around you. 

But the thing is that every time I go to write all of this, my hand won’t stop shaking and my mind cannot piece together coherent sentences. Maybe all of this all for nothing. Maybe my note will just bring them more pain. Maybe they will be disgusted and disappointed to learn just how sick my mind has become. Maybe the note might be a constant reminder of my actions. Maybe they’ll even resent me for having the last word. Maybe they’ll hate me for it. And I don’t want that. I don’t want to be some sort of momento. I don’t want to leave behind pieces of myself. I don’t want my note to be constant reminder to the people around me of the girl that once was here.  I don’t want anything other than to just disappear. I just want to be a distant memory. I want to rewrite history so it was like I was never there to begin with. 

A part of me is also wants to protect my family. If I put in my paper that I died through suicide, it would just make everything so real. My family would know that my death wasn’t some accident or that I hadn’t just died peacefully in my sleep. They would know that it was suicide. And god I hate that word. I hate having to put a label on myself. Or you know what, what the hell, maybe I’m being stupid because of course they’ll eventually know that it was suicide. But what if, just what if there was a slight possibility that they would convince themselves that it was all a lie. Maybe without me directing writing a note, my family might keep wanting to hold to the lie that it wasn’t suicide even when all the evidence says something else. I know living in a lie does nothing for a person other than prolong the truth, but what if it could just help them move on.  I want to give that to them desperately, and the more I keep thinking about it, the more I realize that maybe leaving a note would be something worse than having someone kill themselves. Because a note makes everything too blatantly obvious—it makes everything seem almost to harsh and direct. 

But what if they go mad with wondering what made me do it? What if they wonder if it was their fault or if they could have done something? Because the truth is that it’s no one’s fault, and its just that I think I’ve reached the end of this journey. I think I might have even overstayed my visit on this planet we call earth, and I can’t keep doing this to myself. I’m too fucking tired. 

I don’t know. Maybe I just want someone on this site tell me what I’m supposed to do. I’m driving my self crazy with all these thoughts. I don’t expect anyone to read this honestly. I just needed to a form to release these wild thoughts running in my head. 

I’ve gone completely mad.

201061,"Not suicidal but seeking help/adviceHi. I'm not really sure where to start with this or what I'm even looking for so I'll just speak my mind and talk about myself. My life has been a trip to say the least. I'm 27, turning 28 next month. I haven't caught a break since I turned 20 and honestly lately I just don't know. When I was 20 I was pretty much at the top of the world. Healthy, strong, body of a model, 160IQ, can program in multiple languages, very fast learner, women flocking to me, pretty much anything anyone could want. Only negative I could thing is I was dirty poor but it didn't bother me. I met someone named Ashley. A blind date setup from my friend Skylar at Hershey Park. I thought she was cute and it was comfortable being around her. She was a cook and specialized in baking. I forget the name of it but she made this delicious pastry that I think had honey in it. It's probably my favorite to this day. We ended up dating and got engaged after a year. After that my heart started giving out, literally. My heart kept seizing, going into afib, and other abnormalities. It put me in the hospital at least every other month half dead and I'd stay weak after. Then by the time I built my strength back up it would happen again and again and again. Doctors would look at me and see a strong young guy then blow me off. I had to practically beg for medicine to be treated. The antiarrythmic medication is what kept me alive. In the middle of this Ashley started having strokes. She had over 10. It changed her. She ended up in a psych ward twice. I was there as much as I could. Only a few times was I not and it haunts me to this day. I don't expect myself to be perfect but still. I could have done more and I know it. Hindsight is something right. Around the 2year mark of us being together I got hurt bad physically and ended up recovering from surgery for a while. During this literally every 2weeks I was having to stop Ashley from us breaking up. Instead of being there for me she did this. After I recovered about a year later we decided to move out of state. I would go first to get us ready and get us a house. Then we would get married. Not even a month apart she sleeps with a guy she just met a pool party. I find this out when I get a random text from her saying its over. I convince her to meet. We drive to eachother. First thing I do is grab and kiss her. So happy to see her. She cries when she kisses me then tells me what she did. She literally slept with the guy while wearing her engagement ring to me. We ended after that. I dated some after that. My mind wasn't in the right place at the time. I just wanted to forget and move on. Wasn't right but I didn't realize at the time. Where I moved had a lot of my family including my elderly mother who I started taking care of. She got very sick and I saved her life on more than one occasion. Couple years later I meet someone at work. I'll only use her initials here, DT. We worked together around 2years, ended up together, and engaged at 3years. She was married. Fcking foolish me fell in love. I believed her story of married the wrong person because of her family, etc... I found out how much I was being deceived and the truth much later. It ended up costing me my job but in my mind she was worth it. I ended up breaking my back at the next job shortly after starting. It literally made me a cripple at the time and almost put me in a wheelchair. I'm still recovering to this day and might have back surgery #3 coming up soon. After I got hurt my fiance DT, I have never seen a case of dr. jeckle and mr. hyde more than in her. She literally abused the hell out of me in every possible way you could think of. I find out what I was told when I got together was a lie. She married the ex because she was after the better life(he had money). She even had an ex's ring with her during there wedding. She got with me for a similar reason. She's been gone for about a year now and I don't want her. The pain from that abuse is still with me to this day. To double it up this all happened while I'm a cripple I find out that my own mother who I've been taking care of because she didn't always get what she wanted. For example if I went out anywhere without her she would give guilt trips because she wanted to always go with. She trashed me so badly to the family that I've literally been thrown away by my whole family. My aunt, uncle, cousins, little cousins, it's gone now. And my only sin was being there when I was needed. Helping when I was needed. I literally have nothing now. My fiance and I had the same friends so they went with her and my own elderly mother I was taking care of took my family. Kick me while I'm down why don't you. To this day I know what happened and I'm not in denial but it's so hard to believe. It's like I'm living in a nightmare. I'm a cripple who lost everything. If you ask anyone who has known me. I've always been kind and strong both physically and mentally. My only weakpoint mentally, which I knew about but considered it ok, was that I open myself to those I care about. Those are the only ones who could hurt me. Nothing else even phases me. Conditioned be my rough life growing up. This betrayal which it would be one thing if I actually did something but all I did was get hurt and at most as for help. This broke me. For the first time in my life I broke. I've pieced myself together very slowly. Tried new hobbies(got into audio and the music helps when I'm hurting physically or mentally). I don't leave the house. Not to keep the world out or anything like that but because of my injury I physically can't. I only go out for dr appointments. Before my last surgery I practically starved myself so I can drop weight. I was actively losing my legs so this was a last ditch effort to slow the deterioration down(. Then after the surgery I've stuffed my face since to help the healing process. It's helped but I'm not healed yet(If I woke up after the surgery without function in my legs I was going to put a bullet in my brain, not just words, I really mean it). I have nothing anymore. I own a house. Paying off my car slowly(workmans comp barely gives enough for the bills). That's all I got. That's it. Every day I'm doing everything I can so I can heal physically and mentally. I want a new life. Every day I just want to put a for sale sign in the front and any little bit of money I'd make if any(a thousand or two at most). Move somewhere and start a new life. Honestly I'm thinking of how I could move to a different country and start truly fresh(I'm in the USA now). If that's not possible probably the west coast then. Benefit of being a nurse is if I heal enough from the injury I can work almost anywhere. If you read this far I want to say thanks.

201063,"I'm really confused…..like really fucking confusedI don't even know. I hate but love life at the same time. Kinda like a game and I'm just a role. I also feel like my depression is fake. If I really wanted to I could snap out of it and I'm just overreacting. I'm finding humor in everything atm and constantly laughing my ass off. I don't take shit serious anymore. Unlike before I feel very light and frothy instead of emo and depressed. I don't feel……real anymore like everything is fake at this point and I'm kinda just going with the flow. It's like I'm going insane. But every once in a while I snap back into reality and it all breaks down and I get a rush of intense emotions and become really suicidal and miserable but the next day I'm totally fine. Like a zombie I feel like this day has been on repeat for the last 5 months (and it was like this before quarantine). Anyway my mental state is very inconsistent and I can't tell what I feel anymore. 

Did I mention that I let myself go this year and gained probably 20 pounds this year to my 5'4 self. To give you some background I was very much obsessed with my weight last year and lost a ton of weight unhealthily. I feel like shit about my body at the moment and that only causes me to stress eat and worsen the self hate cycle. I'm suicidal but at the same time I'm just chilling and enjoying lazying at home. But not very much enjoying since it's mostly self loathing (this was really repetitive but you get the gist)

The point of this was to kinda understand what I'm going through cause I can't get through anything right now and I'm in denial and am refusing to get therapy. If I keep going like this I think I'll mess up everything and end up in a hospital again if I go down this path and that inconveniences everyone because of my selfishness.

My girlfriend of 4 years who broke up with me and now 2 weeks later is already seeing a bunch of other guys. 5 days after, my dog died. She was my bestfriend since she was born five years ago and is now gone. I took the next day off work to build a casket for her and bury her. I didn't let my boss know and he fired me because of my performance for the last week which I had just been sad over because of my girlfriend which I completely understand. I have been looking for a job this past week and still nothing. I'm not going to be able to pay rent this month and soon I'll be out on the streets. My family is all in Mexico so I have no help plus I don't want to ask them seeing as they sent me to this country to become successful and am now dirt poor.

I saw a new psychiatrist today and told her the same thing. She prescribed zoloft even though I told her I have taken in before and it did not help. I didn't get anything for anxiety. I'll admit that I'm looking for a benzo because I've tried all the other anti-anxiety meds.

Anyway, I am 21 years old. I am attending college right now and live with my parents and five other siblings. My dad is the issue though because he is never happy about anything; not even his own kids. I'm 100 percent sure he's bipolar as well as schizophrenic and severely depressed. He became disabled in 2005 when his diabetes took his sight to the extent that he can no longer drive nor work. He's never happy for any body though and he's always complaining about my mom and how she never does anything at work. My mom is a personal care assistant and thus, takes care of elderly people who need assistance in being cared for. I think he has no room to talk because he no longer works and whatever he does contribute to the family is monetary. Money is great though. I guess I'm just trying to ask about different coping techniques to practice. How can I ignore him? 

Before you suggest moving out, I can't. I left my job last June and am aware of the huge mistake I have made for myself. I can't concentrate well enough to pass the driving test to get a license even. I have become so stressed to the point of leaving all my friends in reality and secluding myself due to embarrassment of my lack of achievement. I'm not trying to compare myself to them but when your own father is a huge piece of shit who isn't happy for anyone and one day yells at you, calls you retarded, doesn't recognize your sexual orientation and then another day, is completely fine and dandy playing video games on his tablet, it becomes a crippling thing.

Well, I blew it... I'm done, completely and utterly done... Tomorrow is the first day of school where I live. I'm suppose to be a senior, but instead this year I'm not attending. High school was hell from the start from me. It's all due to the fact that I was too lazy to wake up in the morning to even attend, too insecure about my looks to want to be seen in public, too quiet and secluded to make any connections, too rebellious to want to obey any authority figure, and most of all, too apathetic to even care. Now it's over, I was told that if I didn't get my act together that this day would come, but I didn't listen... I am so fucked right now.

What the fuck am I going to do with my life? How am I going to get money? I am so stuck right now. I am so isolated right now. I don't even have any real friends, I have no places to go, nothing to do, and nothing to even look forward to. I am a total failure. I don't see any way I can get out of this.

My life up until this point has sucked, my parents had no business with one child, yet decided they needed a second.  I was an accidental and I've kind of always known it.  My parents were and are terrible with money, we never really had what we needed, I was sick a lot but going to the doctor was a rarity.  I spent most of my younger years being called lazy, told how I'll never succeed, all because my brother was a genius who refused to work, meanwhile I struggled, and eventually when I realized nobody cared, I gave up.

My mother was an addict, it honestly made my life hell, she would forget to pick me up and drop me off, most plans would be canceled, promises broken, I nearly died quite a few times in the car with her. I stopped sleeping in high school, it was either that or let the house burn down. I never got over that, I wake up hourly and immediately feel alert and alarmed. For a while in high school I just... Didn't have a place to live.

I worked my ass off after high school, I greased trucks for minimum wage to save for college, I already had $6000 saved back and planned to add to it. Well, turns out no, that money all went to drugs, on top of that my mother got my car stolen (also drug related).

I went to a cheap shitty school after that, still ended up $80k in debt, I had to face the fact that I wasn't smart enough for the degree I wanted, I couldn't cut it, so I made the choice to get another degree, one I have much less interest in, and which is much less useful.  Now I work a shit job that barely gives me 20 hours a week.  I can't afford to leave, and I don't have a skillset worth getting a relocation package.  I can't afford to leave unless I want to be homeless, which I promised myself I wouldn't do again...

College was the only time in my life I felt ok, I had friends, I was an executive officer of a club, I let myself get comfortable though, and so I lost it, someone stacked the vote and our entire executive board got kicked out.  After college I had to move back home, all I do now is sleep and work.  My family genuinely believes that I SHOULD do nothing but work, it's ""just what you do"" and I ""would quit feeling so pitiful"" if I got an 80 hour work week, I shouldn't want to leave this shitty small town, because ""big towns is nothing but trouble!"" They cannot understand why anyone would NOT want to live in the middle of nowhere. According to them the epitome of fun is hammering tomato stakes into the ground...

I went to therapy a while back. My family is kinda supportive but only at really bad times. Any time I look better they stop paying my meds and everything.
A few months ago I felt really really awful all the time and went to the psychiatrist. I am on meds now. Stronger than those before. It helped me go back to study (I dropped out of University 2y ago because of my mental health)
Since social distancing I am back at my room all day, I try to read stuff be the only time I feel better is when I punch my wall or hurt myself
My father is a very religious old man and doesn't allow me to express myself at the house about politics, women's rights which honestly doesn't help. A few nights ago I said I don't think women are sluts because of their clothes and he said If I said one more word about things I don't understand he would hurt me.
So now I am stuck here. At this house. With my mind. 
The only 'thing' I had is over now and so I don't feel hope.
I didn't did it yet because I don't want my nieces to feel that much damage to them. But I have really been struggling...

No matter how this ends, I feel like I will be happy. 
I've done extensive research in regards to my faith, I don't think I'll go to hell for it.

My decision starts here.
09/13/11

The month, day, and year I made the worst conscious decision of my life. To abort my first, and only child. I am not 22. The decision still haunts me to this day. 
I hate everyone who supports such an awful thing. To deny someone of life. 
Things were bad then, and have only gone down since then.
I'm now 22.

Now for my decision. I decided that on the 13th of this month (August) I will begin my journey to better my life. 
I will give myself one month, until the day of my child's death to feel good about my life, and turn my life around.

If I cannot. If things do not improve. I will take my life. 
I've gone through extensive planning. 

Today (the remainder of) I will finish writing my plans, and decorate a journal I will keep to document my time.
Tomorrow, the 12th, I will clean my room, and pack everything I own away in boxes to keep the burden off my father and mother as best as I possibly can. 

I know that if I fail, they will hate me in death, as I have coaxed them to do so in life. However, they only pity me. 

I'm unhappy.
So many things have made me such. 
Despite my depression, which has such a tight hold on my life.  I'm tired of fighting, so let this be my final fight. 

I currently suffer from clinical depression and manic depressive disorder, as well as anxiety due to depression. I anxiety linked to agoraphobia, un officially diagnosed (they weren't sure, thought it was delusional disorder because of my ""made up"" delusions about my body, so why not lump everything together?)
Which makes it extremely difficult to go outside. I get anxiety attacks, black out. etc. 

My goals for this month are to:
See a doctor
Start medication
Regular Exercise
Work on my stream

I have to do these things alone. Why? I have no one. No, I don't have anyone.  No ""What about a friend"", no ""Ask your parent"" no  ""Siblings?"" No. Even if I went to a family member, it's always the same. ""I can't take the time off work."", ""Oh, it'll pass"", ""Oh, it's all in your head."", ""When will you stop faking?"" 
I have guys who would do it for me, however they expect a fuck, or me to be their girlfriend in return.
Currently I'm talking to a past lover, however I don't want him to feel this is his fault, or make him feel any type of way. He never understood my condition before, he won't now. 

Anyways.
Small, but it will be the decider. 
It's amazing how peaceful I feel, coming to this conclusion. 
I will keep the forum updated. Godspeed.",suicide

I thought college would be better than high school cause I would be treated like an adult and have more say in what I do. But now I just feel like I'm being bleed dry of everything I have to offer. One of my professors emailed me today asking if I was okay because ""you're very attendant but you're missing a lot of assignments"". I just started bawling because I'm really not okay.

I'm stuck in an abusive household and I'm being forced to go to school because my parents want my money. I hate money so much. It's the only thing my parents seem to care about and it makes life so much harder. I just want to disappear under mysterious circumstances and be declared dead. This life that I'm working towards just doesn't seem worth the effort. I don't want to be a wage slave, I don't want to be in debt for the rest of my life. I just want to live with my friends and my sisters and not have to worry about if I'm going to have enough to eat or stay in my house. It's not fair. Why even bring me into this world?

I'm not going to do anything to harm myself because I still have something. It's a feeble hope but it's there. I'm just not sure what to do. I'm not sure there is anything I can do besides continuing this cycle.",suicide

There are distractions, but those only last for an hour, maybe two - when I drink they last longer, and I end up forgetting for up to a day, but then it just comes back.  Sometimes, I'll just look at porn all day, and that at least keeps my mind away.  I'm a PhD student, and I'm failing my classes.  I don't really have any friends - I had friends, back at home, but here, I only have acquaintances.  In fact, I felt like I'd found a group of people that I actually enjoy being with - that was a year ago, and I had about 8 months to spend with them.  Then it was gone, and now I'm here, in a cold, dark city, surrounded by ""friends"" that I'm not very fond of, and I feel that they're not that fond of me.  I always told myself that I'd work hard and happiness would come later - now I'm at the university of my dreams, as a PhD student, and I'm realizing that I might not be smart enough or strong enough to do this.  Sure, if I fail out this semester, then I'll be able to find a job afterwards, but what then?  I had a year of work experience before this, and every single day was the loneliest, most depressing experience of my life.  I had no friends, nothing to look forward to - the only thing I actually looked forward to was the end of the internship, but there's no end like that when you start your career.  I always think about it, and I always come to the conclusion that I should just end it instead of living in my deathbed for the next 50-60 years.  Because that's what it felt like, and these thoughts scare me a lot - I daydreamed today about what the least painful way to die would be, what I would write in a note, if I would write a note, how could I do it without anyone knowing for the longest time, or maybe there is some way that I can do it without hurting my family.
Is there some secret to life that I've been unaware of my whole life?  Am I missing some integral part of the human experience that would make me whole?  I'm not asking for people to talk me out of anything - at this point, it's just a hypothetical that's been developing very very slowly.

I was linked here from a AskReddit post which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1d27d6/whats_bothering_you_right_now_what_do_you_need_to/).

So I guess I'll give some backstory: Around 6 years ago, I moved from my home country (New Zealand) to another country. I don't really want to give out specifics, so sorry if that's against the rules. When I got there, I was in a different country with a different culture, language etc. The novelty of ""wow this is so cool"" wore off fairly quickly as I went too school and I started school fairly cheerfully.

On my first week of school, I broke down crying at recess. I had no friends, and I didn't really know what to do. I got a friend, but I had changed. I wasn't as cheerful, and I started to become depressed. I started to fake being sick so I didn't have too go to school. I was 7.

Fast forward by two years, and I believed I was being bullied. I was called a nerd, a snot-picker among other things almost daily. Though, my memory may be warped as it was quite a while ago. I was 10 when this happened, in Fourth Grade.

Fast forward two more years, and you will come to a 11/12 year old who is emotionally unstable. I couldn't trust anyone. Anyone who was my ""friend"" I basically clung onto because I was so unstable. Before the day I moved, I never really had ""no"" friends, I always had someone. I never thought I had any friends, despite having them. I just didn't realize.

Fast forward two more years, and you now arrive at a 14 year old who has thought about suicide, has written suicidal notes before, taken tests, seen therapists, and just wants to end it all. He is tasked with a huge amount of school work, has a mother who micromanges his life, and has been suffering head-aches and other things like that. I am not allowed to stay at home, as school requires me to go to school, unless I want to spend multiple days catching up. This is me now.

And honestly, I've had enough. I know how to commit suicide, and I've thought how to do it before. I've seen two therapists before, and I've had too leave both of them due to me leaving schools. The school I go to currently is small (around 60 people max), and doesn't have that much of a variety in people as a result. I'm starting to doubt whether or not I should continue on with life. I've been feeling like crap lately, especially during school. I've had too deal with headaches, stomach aches, and I'm fed up with it. I took a test during an IQ in which the doctor suggested I take some anti-depressants, which I refused as I heard they could make you ""flat"" in a way. I now regret that decision.

I'm an avid gamer, and I usually play games to get my mind off things, but that's been happening less and less as my mother takes control of my life a lot more. She is going to University, and has a generally stress-filled life, which doesn't help at all. It also doesn't help she changes our diet whenever she sees something that she thinks will help the family, which leads to me being angry due to the fact she's spending more money on food when she could just save a bit by not buying half of the brands she does. Most of my family (e.g. father etc.) are away in another country, and generally have other things to do.

I'm not sure what to do. I've tried to make myself feel better, but I've basically lost motivation to do things. Most of my days are spent reading reddit, doing nothing else. I get pretty good grades at school (generally near-top of the class marks), yet I'm still told to ""make study notes and study every day"" from my mother, who believes I should be getting A+++ marks for every assignment. I've basically just lost all motivation to live, and the only thing keeping me going is the fact that I don't want to disappoint people. I feel like I'm pulling people time, and I've been skipping meals so my mother won't have too spend so much on people.

Plus, it doesn't help most of my classmates are social rejects. I just don't feel like I fit in anywhere, which leads me to the Internet, where I strangely do feel like I fit in.

Welp, I'm just going to stop there, as that's just one gigantic ramble/rant. I just don't know what to do. I haven't seen a therapist lately, which helped me before, and I'm scared to ask for one as my mother may say ""you don't need one"". I just need some help, some advice, anything to help me get through this hellhole that is my life.

I hope I don't sound self-entitled or anything. My mother tells me that, as I quote, ""don't have it so bad"". I'm not sure of that, but I have seen that people have it worse.

I would just love it if somebody gave me some help, and sorry if this is incredibly rambley/ranty.",suicide
201209,"When do I get to be happy?Hello friends,

I come here often, but today I am posting on this sub from a throwaway. Yesterday was my 26th birthday, and I wanted to kill myself more than I have in any moment in my life, except for perhaps the moment that I type this. I no longer have anyone in my life who I can share my true feelings and attitude toward life with anymore, so I will post them here for anyone who will listen and read my words. 

I use the word ""anymore"" because that is the cause of the abject despair which I now find myself in. 7 months ago my girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me. She was my everything, and so too did I think I was her everything. She was my best friend, she was my reason to get up in the morning, she was my reason to continue living... I still do not understand why, what I did wrong, none of it makes any sense to me. She told me it was to work on herself, but that I couldn't be a part of it. She told me she intended to write a letter beforehand, but that she didn't have it in that moment, so she would send it to me. I told her that in that moment while I didn't understand, that I would have to accept it, and wait for her letter that would explain why. 

We both cried from the bottom of our hearts, she told me that she thought that we were going to get married, and I also told her the same. I did not understand why this was happening. I moved out and waited for the letter. I waited every day. Holding out hope that the person who I loved and cherished more than anything else in the world, who I wanted to give everything to, to show that them that they were enough, would send me this letter to explain everything. 

I have waited every day for these past 7 months for her letter. It still hasn't come, and still I hold out hope that it will come. It will never come. I am languishing in the pits of despair every day wondering ""why?"" I want to know why I can't come on the journey too, why I can't be there even when she told me that I was the love of her life? I want to know. 

I remember when I took her in for stomach surgery, they finally allowed me to go back and wait with her while the anesthesia wore off. She was asleep. She was always so peaceful and cherubic when she was asleep - looking at her washed away the constant state of dread I find myself in wanting to take always my own life. When the anesthesia wore off, she looked around the room scared, until she saw me. Her eyes filled up with tears and she said ""I'm just so glad that you're here,"" and I cried as well. We had a true connection - but those days are gone. 

I have struggled with suicidal ideations all of my life. They follow me just as my own shadow does when walking down a dark street that is faintly lit. When my ex-girlfriend, who also struggles with suicidal thoughts, broke up with me, she made me promise her that I would not kill myself, and that she would do the same. I promised her that I would not. I wonder then - what do I owe her? I don't owe her anything. Her words turned out to be hollow - I wish she had never told me she would write me this letter. Her words don't mean anything anymore. 

In these past 7 months, everyday that drags on feels worse than the last. I feel worse than the last. Sometimes I don't sleep for days on end. I wait for the letter. Patience turns to anxiety. Anxiety becomes frustration. Frustrations gives way to anger, and anger becomes contempt, bitterness, and hatred. For her. For myself. Especially for myself. My worldview is warped. I am full of hatred. I am sure many of you have experienced this feeling: the burning, unending frustration and rage that you feel over the powerlessness you have over your happiness - it feels so hot in your skull that your head might combust. 

She says that she ""just wants to be happy."" With that I posit a question: When do I get to be happy? It definitely isn't 7 months. 70 months? 7 years? 70 years? Never? All things come to an end, but I know that the yawning emptiness that exists within me will only end when I end. I want to disappear. For the love of your life, that you gave up everything for - when they tell you ""I don't know what I want in life right now, I just know that I don't want you..."" It is too painful. I can't describe this heartbreak. I wish that I didn't exist. I wish that I could just be wiped off of this planet in an instant. Out of this reality - and join the cosmic nothingness. 

A friend asked me if I learned anything from my relationship. I thought for a second, saddened by the answer I arrived at. ""No,"" I told them. ""In the end my worst insecurities and fears about myself were confirmed to be true."" I was stunned by my realization. I wish that this could all go away. All the memories. All the good times with a person who I never really even knew. Everything reminds me of her. I will go through life alright one day, and see something that reminds me of her, something as innocuous as a chocolate milk, and break down in tears, reminded of all of the times that I would pick her up breakfast from Brueggers and she would always ask me ""did you get me a chocolate milk?"" and the smile on her face when it would materialize from my pocket. 

I wish that I could tell you that typing this up made me feel better - that I got something off of my chest. It was the opposite. I have confirmed to myself that I am damaged beyond repair. I have not healed at all. I am in absolute agony. I sometimes think that perhaps I could move on if I was not stuck in the same position because of this stupid pandemic, relegated to living with my parents, with someone else, and then I realize: what if I hurt another person the way that I was hurt? I couldn't live with myself. I can barely live with myself right now.

My ex-girlfriend would often compare her struggles to the Greek mythological figure Sisyphus, who is condemned by Zeus to infinitely a roll a boulder up a hill for all of eternity. She would say ""I am Sisyphus."" It makes me think of my current predicament. If I were to put myself in the analogy, I have been crushed by the boulder infinitely. 

To be honest with you, the only reason that I have not killed myself in my 26 years of existence is because of my mother. Once, I had a dream where I killed myself. It felt so real, more than anything I had ever experienced. Time was moving slow, and I was alone with my thoughts, knowing I was going to die and that it couldn't be undone. In that moment, I cried. I wanted one last hug from my mom. Maybe it would have changed something. 

While I typed this, I cried so much more than I thought I would. It is not the type of cathartic crying one has when they feel a release of pressure. This is the type of crying one does when they are disgusted with themselves. A grieving and pain that makes you wish that you had never been born into this world. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By an apartment I used to live in, there is an extremely long bridge with an extremely tall drop off. I often take walks there and meditate by this bridge when I am feeling this way. I have also often dangled my legs over the edge, debating if I should go over, but never doing so. Being so close to life and at the same time death if I were to choose it - it puts me in a strange headspace. I am going to take a walk there now and clear my head. 

I think about what it would be like in the moment that I really did it. How scared and alone I would feel. I would think about my mother and her hugs. I would probably think about my ex-girlfriend too. I would think about my dad who didn't support my ambitions, and most importantly, I would think about me, and how much of a piece of shit I am who couldn't even keep the love of his life in his life... I think about hitting the concrete all at once. I think about the pieces of my skull, splayed across the ground like shrapnel, blood everywhere. That's one way to clear my head right? And then nothing. Forever.  

When I take this walk, I want to know: ""When do I get to be happy?"" Will it ever happen to me? Maybe someone here will identify with my words. I know I will slip all the way off eventually. I just wish things were different.",suicide

201216,"I've been fantasizing about killing myself since I was 13 years old and I think it's timeI'm a 16 year old girl, my life is very average and to be honest most of my problems aren't as worth it and rough to be mentioned. I've struggled with an eating disorder since I was 10, my suicidal thoughts have been around since I can remember and there's nothing I can do to keep them away from my mind; no one has ever noticed any of that, not even my parents. I like to think that this is due to my ""pretending to be ok"" skills but deep down I know is because nobody really gives a shit about me, again, not even my parents. 

Every single decision that I've made since I was conscious about my bad mental state has been made in order to get better and experience happiness for once in my life. Nothing seems to work out, I can't even bother to fuck things up because there's no good thing at all around me, everything is fucked up already and no one really cares about me. 

To be clear, I know that I'm going to eventually kill myself. I have no idea how, when and where but I just know that I am going to do it one way or another. The only thing that haunts me is the fact that my self-induced death will represent a major trauma in my friends' lives and will scar my parents forever. I absolutely don't want that, I just want to go in peace knowing that no one will be hurt in the process or afterwards. 

Maybe my life will get better in a couple of years, maybe if I try harder on therapy somethings will start to go the right way in my life, but the emotions that I've been dealing with for the past couple of years are just too painful, my god they are. 

Only thing I can do is pray that there's no other type of life after death because I ain't willing to breathe anymore after I take my own life, that and distancing myself from everyone so that they find easier to face my death when I eventually commit it. 

I know this hole text can sound overwhelmingly condescending and typical in a depressed teen, and I'm sorry for that but I can't take it anymore. I'm going to wait til my birthday for my final decision even though I'm 100% sure I'll eventually kill myself.

Over a decade long relationship ended recently because I didn't take my mental health seriously, and drank too much, and now I'm living with my abusive mom, who's.. really not nice. Everyday things are getting worse. I'm a complete mess, and I don't have anything really going for me. I'm on disability since I was born to be a waste of space, and I'm just going to have to start over again anyway. Don't really have many material possessions or anything. Pretty much just what would fit in a backpack is all I have, and I'm too exhausted to care anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

It sucks but no one would even miss me either. I don't have friends, I'm not close to anyone in my family and most of them don't really like me. Pretty much the only person who talks to me is my mom, but she didn't take long to start chipping away at me. I don't really like being treated badly and it's not like I have any other options.

201230,"I Wrote SomethingBeen a long time since I wrote something but I really just wanted to get my feelings out. I am not going to do anything soon but death is on my mind constantly; in more ways than not I want to cease to exist. Thanks for reading.

""D---h is easy. Whether you believe it or not, it is.  You as a being just, stop. You cease to be. 

The hard part is all the baggage that comes with death, and this includes much more than the involuntary emptying of your bowels that you hear about on TV and in movies. Dealing with some shit in my pants for others to deal with is something I can take lightly. (Hell, I did it for the first couple years of my life and loved ones actually praised me for it.) What I really have trouble dealing with is the ripple effect that comes from me leaving. 

When I make the jump into the calm water that is death, the water quickly heals waiting for its next permanent guest. But the waves that escape from my jump cause more damage than a tsunami when they make landfall of the living. My friends, family, brothers, parents, and daughter will all be caught off guard when they see that massive wave hurling towards them. And that is the hard part about death. It is all the hurt and heartache for others that stems from my decision to take my game token off the board and not pass “GO”, no matter how many people judge me for not collecting that sweet $200.

Hurting other people has never been a strong suit of mine. I never had a hurtful comeback in time, I could never throw a punch, I couldn’t pain someone on purpose. And that is why leaving would be so difficult. I don’t want to hurt anyone, I just don’t know if I can keep hurting myself daily; even if it upkeeps my loved one’s happiness.

What I really want is to enter the sea of death as a water droplet myself, taking all trace of my presence with me, and leaving no wake to hurt others around me. ""

201232,"just needed to say this before I goNot sure why, but wanted to get my thoughts out before I go.

I am in my 40's, educated, family, etc.

I am done.  Sure, there are the usual reasons (overwhelmed with debt, work etc) but really it is the totality that has pushed me to it.

I just want to say, for some people - cheating seems to be 'normal' and there seems to be this movement to make it justifiable etc/

My wife cheated and we went thru hell.  It was a long term affair with a co-worker (boss), and I had to prove it - no confession.

We had horrendous ups and downs, separated, reconciled, and are together.  We have children.  No abnormal problems with our marriage - no fighting, we were genuinely friends, but she got bored basically, and he was 'there for her' (he has been shown to be a total slimebag player since then).

I have tried.  I really have - doctors, therapy, even hospitalization.  I can only speak for myself - but there is no getting over it.

She has been perfect the last year.  But your brain never stops.  You never stop re-living what they did, asking 'why?' - it just never stops.  I put on a brave face, I plow on, but it is like being randomly stabbed throughout the day.  And I know it will never end.

I can't 'just leave'.  That won't end it anyway. I have been battling for years.  this is just insanity.

So I just want to say - if you are married, in a committed relationship, etc - please don't cheat.  Do anything else - break up, talk, confront your partner with your issues - but don't cheat.  It is just so bad, so painful and destructive - and the person you cheat on NEVER gets a day off from their brain reminding them in some way what happened.  It's exhausting and so so painful.

I don't know how to start this but I don't wanna overthink this as I overthink everything always.

Warning : very long, but I poured my heart into this, so please be kind for a few minutes to read this.

Since I was a kid it felt like I was destined to fail. I had an alcoholic father and had to move to my uncle with my mom and brother. I legitimately didn't have a real childhood, just constant running away from one of my parents while bearing the pain of having to come to my own home sometimes to see my father dead drunk on the kitchen floor, and other instances where we had to hide or call my uncle to calm him down and shout at him. He was aggressive and short tempered always which could have been caused by his cancer, but he was an alcoholic all the way back from when he was 18. He has never physically harmed any of us, but there was an exception where he has put a hand on my mother and was told by the judge if he does it again he will lose his job and other sanctions which I don't know. To make things worse, we also live with my aunt and her husband(who is never here btw) and her daughter(my cousin). My aunts husband is a piece of shit that blames my mother for his alcoholism and told her he sided with him throughout the whole time. There were some instances that made me almost puke in my mouth a bit. He is a no one to me(talking about that husband now), he did some things for us sometimes but it's nothing, legit fuck all compared to other families and their relations.

The thing that sucks most about this childhood of mine is that I resolved to playing games from a young age(11-12) to engulf my sadness and this is one of the reasons I am so stupid today. I never had a father figure and I don't know shit about anything, cars, computers, any work around the house, I am so fucking incapable of some fundamental things due to my poor upbringing and that hurts me so much that I can't relate with my friends when they talk about such things. I hated middle school, but maybe I was bitter due to my situation...high school was hell first 2 years due to a sadistic teacher(wanna stay anonymous so not gonna say what subject) that ruined many generations and a few other horrible teachers.

In third year I stressed so much that I had to go to the doctor due to my chest hurting. Luckily, all is fine.

Coming closer to the present, 2019 was the worst year in my life. In January I was emotionally manipulated, lied to and degraded by the first person I ever loved, and that was 2-3 days from the 7th year anniversary of my fathers death, this destroyed me emotionally. Then in May I met a girl at prom which I still objectively think was the best for me. We went to 2 dates and after the 2nd we never saw each other because I was a pussy, I didn't make a move and then at the end of it asked for the kiss(I got it though). Although I am not sure this was the reason, cause she left for another city to study so she said she didn't wanna give me false hope, which is okay, but she could have said that at the beginning and not a month after we have known each other. Anyway, to my surprise I got over it somewhat quickly. Then in september I met a girl in a club that was just such a bitch, at first I gave her my number and we chatted a bit and when I asked her out she said she forgot how I look like and even if she did she doesn't want any action now, and then we agreed somehow to meet, but that she will call me in a few weeks, she didn't. Later due to my stubbornness and anger found out she had a bf the entire time. Then in October met a girl while outside with friends drinking, we had a decent first date but after that she ignored me 2 times when we were out. So I decided to block her on all social media, fuck her. I had a few other encounters but they were so irrelevant that they are not worth mentioning. I am happier now because at the end of December 2019 I met a girl from instagram and now we are basically boyfriend and girlfriend.

The problem now is that a part of my family is moving to a bigger house and we will probably live with my uncle for a while and this is a huuuuge deal for me, I have been in this house for almost 20 years and leaving it now(even though I had bad memories with it) will have an impact on me, although going to college will be easier and this is a change needed cause we were 2 families in 1 house and we don't really like each other that much. I know this is petty and uncalled for from me, but I HATE the fact that I have such a small shitty family and that I couldn't have the privilege that many other peers of mine had. I feel so left out and sad when I hear other family related stories so I think you can get my frustration.

I am in university now, I am doing okay, but this one subject I can't pass due to my laziness and insomnia and not having that subject in highschool, it's extremely hard for me and I feel so fucking stupid. I wanna change for the better but my position doesn't allow me, in regard of home and mental state. Sometimes I get so bored that I fall into depression, feel like a burden too. Somedays I feel like I can just end my life to end my suffering and unfair life from start to ""finish"".

I was really down and fucked up but I successfully finished highschool back then and now I'm joining the army. I'm not depressed anymore ever since I left highschool and left behind all the bullshit and depressing memories and I'm glad all those people I hate are not a part of my life anymore. Things got better, we have a strong bond with my family, especially my mother who is still fighting cancer, she might have less than a year left... In this time we've built a new house and in the old one are apartments for 3 families so I can basiclly live good just off of the rent. I'm so glad I didnt end my life throught the long depressing years of my highschool. I'm happy I'm still here, things got better for me and it will for you too. I never belived this shit myself since I've been going through years and years and years of hard times and depression and humiliation and hate and my mom's cancer and all the other fucked up shit. Now I'm glad I've waited and still here as things got better, you just gotta belive and pray for better days. Please dont kill yourself, you will find joy sooner or later. When you will look back like I do now you will see this depressing years just as a small part of your life. Wait for the better parts, it's worth it!

201286,"asking for help means I'm not sick enough?I'm getting progressively more suicidal, and I've dealt with suicidal ideation for years now, including an attempt and one hospitalization due to it. But this time it's... different. I can usually handle the thoughts, I've gotten pretty good at ignoring them and distracting myself but now it feels like every turn I take there's just a new one telling me to kill myself, to take control and just do something drastic.
So, I wanna admit myself so that I stay safe, because of my dissociative episodes along with just pure impulse, I don't trust myself to stay safe. But last time I tried to admit myself they said that ""because I asked for help there's still a part of me that doesn't want to die, so I'm safe enough on my own"" 
so shoutout to the nurses that made me feel like asking for help means I'm not sick enough!! my suicide note will be dedicated to you :)

I just want to feel safe again. Can anyone back me up and tell me that the nurses were bullshit and writing me off as being ""fine"" was wrong? It was close after that that I actually attempted.

Please see (https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/3uowvm/loosing_motivation_feeling_worthless_self_esteem/) 
I used to be a very cheerful and happy person years ago. I had everything I could ask for and was successful and doing well. Now things have changed (see linked post).

I don't know what to do and apart from academics I have a ton of other problems. 

I drank some bleach and then realized I shouldn't do that and that it would affect the few people I know me. I vomited it out instantly and did not drink a lot. 

I don't want to be like this. I want to go back to who I was and restart everything. What I hate the most is that I am acting differently around people because of my mental state. 

I am an extremely patient person, and I could really bond with people because of that and people liked me. Now I want to stay far from everyone cause I fear I'll hurt them.

""I have always been interested in the field I am currently studying. I got many awards for it, achieved a lot in it before entering university.

However when I entered university things did not go so well for me due to sickness and other reasons. I am in good health now (maybe not mentally) however since I failed some courses and did excellent apart from my failures. This makes me feel scarred.

I feel worthless and I keep underestimating myself. This is a vicious cycle because it leads me to do worse and worse as time goes on. I fail to get what I want in every aspect of life these days not just courses. I present myself as an idiot.

I can't believe what has become of me right now, from what I was. I miss my old self, how can I go back. I just wish I could restart everything but I can't. I had hopes for graduate studies now I will never get that. I need some successes to boost my self esteem but for successes I need self esteem.

Yeah, I've made friends already -- people at work that I get along with really well. I started ""dating,"" even though that's not the proper word for it. Friends with benefits would be more accurate, which breaks my heart because, yanno, I feel things way too deeply and fell in love with him and he doesn't feel the same. But that's a completely different issue. 

But I'm still so lonely. Because I'm realizing that I need to be needed. I *need* it, otherwise I feel like I'm a waste of space. Sure, people care about me and want me around. But if I were gone, would anyone be lost without me? Would anyone cry themselves to sleep because they need to see me, touch me, hold me, and can't? 

No. No one would. Because I'm just convenient. I'm the person people go to when they have no one else. I'm everyone's backup, but no one's priority. It was even like that in my marriage. I didn't realize it at the time, but now it's painfully clear. 

And I don't know how to live like this. I don't know how to be by myself and know that I'm totally, completely, utterly alone. I don't know how to see value in myself when no one else can see it. 

I try to occupy my time. Spend time with me. Go for walks or lunch or shopping. I spend time with my work friends. I spend time with the guy I'm seeing. But no one is ever really there for me. They all have someone else. A significant other, a child, a friend. And when I really, really need them, they aren't there. Part of me knows I should just drop them. Because if they can't be there for me when I need help then they aren't good friends. But right now, I'll take bad friends over no friends at all. 

But then I look stupid. Because I throw out help lines. Little hints that, hey, I'm not okay. I need you. And when they go unnoticed, I make it more obvious. When someone finally takes the bait and I open up, I feel like a burden. Like they just wish I'd shut up so they can deal with their own lives and not worry about me. 

So what's the fucking point? Why am I here? No one needs me. I have nothing going for me. So just fucking quit. Give up. Just die. Because why not? Why do I have to put myself through this torture?

When I visited Amsterdam for the first time again, 15 years later, I felt at home. Heck, the airline lost my luggage so I lived off of two shirts and a pair of leggings for those five days, and hardly even noticed. 

I hate back ‘home’. I hate my life here. 
I live in the suburbs- where you have to take APs or you’re considered unmotivated, where you have to drink every Friday night to fit in. The town has tried to suppress my individuality and I let them- but this year, I bounced back. I did my makeup super punk and heavy, I wore clothes that I liked, I tried talking to more people. 

So while I feel connected to myself, I feel so detached from the world around me. I’m lonely. I’m basically being cheated on, my friends can’t help me with my problems, medication doesn’t do anything. 

I just want to be gone. 

I can’t keep turning on the TV and witness Cuomos address of the rising death toll. I can’t live in a world where the economy is put over basic human rights and lives. I can’t live in a world where THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO GET RICH, HAVE KIDS TO DO THE SAME THING, AND DIE.

Ever since seventh grade I have been utterly obsessed with this one girl. I can't at all explain it, she's so dreamlike and perfect and I've thought about her 24/7 ever since i laid eyes on her. It got so bad that just a year later I had suicidal thoughts over the fact she rejected me after asking her out. I've cried until it physically hurt so many times I've become numb to every sort of sadness and bad feeling, except for death and my feelings for her. 

I'm now a junior in high school and these thoughts have only gotten worse since. I've tried therapy, medication, and today I contemplated driving my car into oncoming traffic saying it would be easy and painless. But I can't kill myself because; 1. What it would do to my family and friends, and 2. I still haven't had the satisfaction of being with her yet. My whole life revolves around her and my grades and personal life have gone to shit as a result. I would die at the drop of a hat for her and would fucking kill to get with her (something else I've thought about). Her and I are friends and we're both still in band (where I met her), but it really does feel like life is just tormenting me with this shit.

I can't actually get with her because she has a boyfriend in the next city over, and i want to rip his spine out or something.   She's also a bit of a slut which pisses me off every time I hear she gets with someone, because that someone could've been me. I honestly feel like a useless psychopath who should just rot in hell.

201319,"I really don't know what else to do.My entire family hates me and tells me I'm selfish. My mom is kicking me out of the house in a month if I don't find a job. 

I tried to help by doing my part the best I can but everyday is a constant battle with them because often they are unhappy with what I do. 

I don't believe in god and I can't tell my family, a common issue, and it isn't the worst thing. But it still hurts I can't be open about who I am.

My dad works several hours a day and my mom stays at home doing hardly anything all day. It has been like that for a long time. She used to be a hoarder which had a big impact on my childhood...not being able to have a safe, clean home to live in really sucked, Especially since whenever I tried to clean she would yell at me for throwing away, ""perfectly good"" items (moldy shirts and what not).

My brothers and Sister don't get angry at our mom. They don't see that our childhood should have been much safer and our mom should have been more responsible. I feel as though they are manipulated by her or afraid of her.

I still don't have my GED and I am almost 19. My parents home-schooled us but just kind of stopped caring after a while.

When I was sixteen I would cut myself and I asked my parents if I could get therapy or counseling for it. My mother told me no because, ""If an employer sees you had therapy they won't hire you.""

My cousin was in an abusive relationship and I told her everyday that she deserved better. She would tell me off and say how she was in love with her abusive boyfriend and that I didn't understand. She is out of that relationship now and I am happy for her, But it still hurts that she never thanked me or her other two good friends for staying by her side, when a lot of her friends abandoned her.

I really have no idea what their or my mental state is but there is something wrong with either them, me, or all of us. There is something wrong and I don't know how to fix it. 

I don't want to be the problem child anymore but I also don't want to give in to my moms whim and play along as if it's ok to live in filth and chaos. I have no Idea what to do anymore because I have no access to any kind of professional counseling for me or my family.  

I do have one last small glimmer of hope. My boyfriend wants me to find a job in the next town over and move in with him. If I did my situation would be a lot better. However it would be really difficult to do this as I have five dollars to my name and no car, no phone, no job, and no education.

If I killed myself now, I won't have to worry about my family problems or finding a job or achieving my dreams or anything. I will be asleep. At rest. I won't have to worry anymore. I just want to shut off. I want to stop, to be stopped. Anything.

The problem is that Im just a very useless teenager with absolutely no skills and no way to go from here. I’ve never made a good friend and no matter how much I try no one seems to be interested in me at all. I dont blame them. I’m a pathetic fucking person an I dont deserve to exist.

So here is everything wrong with me. I‘ve always wanted to list it out but never could because then people will think that you are self absorbed and care only about yourself. Which is not the case because I want to sort my shit out and actually be so some use.

1. I have the social skills of an Alien; I can’t keep a conversation going and when the ball comes to me, I just drop it.
2. I have 0 athletic ability; As a teenager, every who seems to be able do some sport. I live in a country where sport is not free and you have to pay alot to even do it an hour once a week. I was doing tennis that way for about a year and my dd told me to drop it because of how expensive it was getting. As a kid I was not really into it when I had the opportunity which was kind of my fault, but still it does not change the fact that I dont have any athletic ability. 
3. I have 0 musical ability; I would like to learn so many things but my parents arent interested. My parents told me to opt out of music when I was 11 so I’ve never had any lessons. I just feel like the opportunity to be an interesting person just vanished.
4. I am absolutely useless to society; I other countrys teenagers can do jobs and stuff like that that make you useful. Well I cant and Im always stuck in my room not knowing what to do with my life.
5. I look ugly as fuck. I am a living wart and thats all you need to know.
6. I dont game at all, and I have no idea how even the most popular games work because apart from a really old nintendo DS I had as a kid, I’ve never really had the guts or the opportunity (due to the lack of any friends) to play any games.

Given all of this, its seems like the world would just be fine if I disappeared and no one will feel bad. 

However, there a few things that are actually not catastrophic about me.

1. I am good at academics. I like science and math and do well at them. I have good tutors and I am fine that way. I want to be a doctor, but the aforementioned faults may prevent me from going to medical school.
2. I like writing and I’ve finished a novel. Granted, it sucks af, but its a book I wrote and I am proud.
3. I actually live a decent life and I have everything I need to survive. I’m very middle class.

I just need someone to go through my post and tell me what to do.

So Thursday went by fine until 3 pm.  I got an email from John Byner.  He is a semi famous old comedian.  It said blah, blah, blah. Not important.  But he was responding to an email I had sent him at 5'30 that morning.  I didn't send him an email but I checked my outbox and there it was.  I was awake at the time of the email stamp on my sent message.

Not only had I not thought about John Byner in a very long time, my email apparently said the exact opposite of how I feel and what I know.  I asked a question that I knew the answer to and was very easily googled.

But at least he replied professionally.  I checked Twitter and 2 other people said they were thinking about John Byner and his show Bizarre at [about the same time. eg.](http://twitter.com/#!/1053koolfm/status/43651346624282624).  

I have been severely clinically depressed for along time and this makes me think I am going over the edge.

I cant start at the beginning because it will be too long.  Now I am a stereotypical unemployed loser now essentially  living in my mother's basement with health problems.

But, and here is the twist, ""I used to be somebody"" and now everything is gone and there is no way I can get it back. Big mistake. I have made 100s of gs a year, but its all gone.  I gave up all of my material goods after the recession kicked in.  A lot.  Mercedes. $35,000 dining room set. Real estate.  etc.  Everything to charity.  I knew I could make it back.  I have three degrees and tons of experience.  I thought I would be able to put myself out in the midst of a great recession and make it without relying on anyone I knew.  But no one cares.  I have lived as an indigent for 2 years and now I am unemployable.  And I have no start-up capital.  I have not been laid in 2 years.

No one to blame for this colossal failure but myself.

I grew up in a very dysfunctional family with a mother who I feel is a narcissist with a personality disorder and a father whose feelings seemed to come and go for me. The first time I wanted to die, I remember I was in about 2nd or 3rd grade and had a bad day at school of kids chasing me around the playground and trying to jump me. I was the fat nerd who never fit in and these kids' mom hated my mom due to personal adult reasons (a man). So, since their mom hated my mom, they had to hate me. I remember running into the school gym trying to get away and a teacher saw me and grabbed me. I had to go to the principal's office and got sent home. On the way home, my mom yelled at me for how it made her look like a bad parent, how I needed to try to beat them up instead of running like a coward, etc. It had been a very stressful time in my life with different changes, my grandparents did not like my mom's boyfriend and that caused them to fight every single day and they always put me in the middle.

I ran to my room and cried on my bed. I realized the only way this would end is if I died. But, I was too scared to do anything. However, these thoughts have carried with me everyday of my life since then.

My mom always blamed everything on me. She lied to men about having kids because kids would keep her from happiness. She would yell and scream and cry because my dad was too drunk or high to pick me up for the weekend and talk about how she needed a break from me. How it wasn't fair she had to deal with me all the time but he didn't have to. I remember thinking that if I just died she would have a break forever.

I have tried a few times to kill myself. I always chicken out. She still tries to run my life. The only way it will end is if I die. My brother is disabled and in her care and she only wants him around for his govt money. He won't leave her. It is all so hopeless and I don't see a point of living anymore. I don't see the point of living at all. I can't be myself and can't live the life I want because she feeds on my insecurities.

Every mistake I make gets amplified and  replayed in my head. I put myself down so often that it has become second nature. All I ever think about nowadays is how worthless and replaceable I am. Because my mind is so cloudy and disgusting, my short term memory and cognitive skills are noticeably laggy.

I've told myself multiple times that it's how I react and move on from failing that matters. That line of thinking helps me temporarily feel better, but l'm not making any progress. I still trip up on words when I talk, disregard deadlines, bomb quizzes and tests, unhealthily lose weight due to poor appetite, and more. Every minor setback sends me into a spiral of self-hatred. 

I'm so exhausted of plateauing in mediocrity and being in a state of disappointment. I go to the top high school in my state, so this feeling of being inadequate is daily. Combined with social anxiety, I don't really fit into any circle of friends either, so the social discomfort only adds on to my exhaustion. I recently lost a close friend who meant the world to me, too. I truly feel alone and invisible. A nuisance for being a waste of space. 

I know killing myself this young is stupid, but the thoughts are pounding in my mind. I hate being a burden to my family and to the few friends I have left. I'm sure they're sick of me complaining about the same shit all the time. The future just seems so bleak to me. I'm scared my social anxiety won't get better, holding me back in college and onward.

I would sit at lunch alone and just stare at the napkins while eating. Then I overlooked everything I did. I found something wrong with everything I did. I grew an extreme hate for myself and there's no going back. I hate myself with a burning passion. I eventually stopped eating at school. Now I can't eat in public in general. I just know everything I do is wrong. From walking, to speaking , to laughing, even to my breathing. I breathe too loud. So yeah now I hate a huge amount of hate for myself and I'm suicidal.

For as long as I've known him, he's been talking about how his life is shit and how nothing works out for him: ""everything's fucking pointless cause this, everything's fucking pointless cause that"". I can't talk sense into him at all. I never was able to my entire life, but he would always say things like ""when I leave this world, I hope you remember me."" I thought this fucker was joking, but I can tell he's not and he's getting serious about it. I'm fucking infuriated because I feel powerless. I feel like a veteran psychologist can't change his mind, and he blocks out everything I say. He says that I'm being selfish because I want him to ""keep on suffering,"" but this fucker doesn't see it the other way. He doesn't see it that I want him alive. And I tell him that, but he doesn't acknowledge it in any way. He just acts like I'm saying it so I can make him suffer more. Fuck no, I think he's a great person. Sure he's a bit quirky, but that doesn't mean he's some low-life that he always claims to be.

This guy fell in love with a girl in college. He claims that he's tried everything to break his ""weaboo"", ""beta"" stigma by working out, drinking, stop watching anime, etc. From the looks of what he's told me, he gone out on a date with her at least once. Apparently, it didn't work out and he's thinking about ending his life. He claims there's more to it, and I'm sure there is, but how many fucking things can go so wrong in your life that you have to kill yourself.

This guy got an intern to Microsoft and he's looking to intern also at Weebly. He's fucking good at what he does, so it's not even like he's going to have a shit future.

I think his parents divorced long ago and I don't think they give him much attention. I'm sure this must have had huge impact on the way he thinks about things, but people around the world have this kind of shit going on all the time. They grow up, they get out of that shit hole. I don't think he's even trying. I think he's so stuck on one belief that he's not going to listen.

201384,"PretendingWhen I was 8 years old I had a very close friend, we were inseparable and did everything together, like a normal kid with his best friend. If he got angry at me I would cry because I thought he was gonna stop being my friend, and he would do the same, pretty adorable right? Well, looking back I actually liked when he cried, (happened maybe twice I guess?) because it made me feel that I mattered to someone, I liked seeing someone worried about me leaving. When we were to finally reconcile it would be very emotional, as emotional as a friendship between two kids can get lol.
I had to switch schools when that year ended and never saw my friend again (nor the rest of my friends of course), it was a bummer but I got over it with time. Nevertheless that feeling of ""being wanted"" never really went away. In third grade I tried, and this time on purpose, having a friendship like that with another kid, I used to pick on him a bit so that he would get sad so that I could apologize and reconcile with him, while expecting that he did  the same sometime in the future. Of course it never happened and I just ended up being a little annoying twat to my poor classmate. 

After many years, I changed to the other side of the role, I liked being pitied, I liked when people felt sorry for me. It was a way of being loved, like when my friend finally forgave me when I was the one crying for him. Of course, he didn't felt sorry for me, he was just sad as well and just wanted to keep being friends with me. The reconciliation part always brought that powerful emotional sensation which felt very good, hard to explain...imagine getting back to your partner after a break up, I believe that's a good way of seeing it.

Fast forward to present day, as I was saying above, I like when people feel sorry for me because I feel I matter. I even have these twisted fantasies of having relatives dying and friends coming in to support me. Sometimes it can get so strong I think about killing myself so that my partner and friends would mourn for me, this usually happens when I'm already feeling bad about other stuff. The thing is, most of the time I don't even actually feel sad, I just want to feel that emotional sensation that comes with being pitied and comforted so I pretend in my mind that I'm depressed and end up fantasizing about suicide and everyone missing me after my death. Now my problem is, I don't know if I'm just pretending or if I'm really suicidal anymore. I have almost lost all fear of sucide by fantasizing about it so much, although I don't actually think I could do it. But when I feel extremely down for other issues (body image mainly, which is a whole other story), I almost always think about killing myself, I have started to seeing it as valid option in case I wanted to stop suffering...

She once told me if she saw a semi or a car coming straight at her she doesn't think she would move. Comments like that almost sends me in tears. I have tried everything I can think of like talking to her about it, telling her im here for her, telling her that things will get better and that she isnt worthless and that everybody has a purpose and yours is teaching kids.

You can’t improve if you don’t acknowledge that there’s something wrong with you and you’ll be stuck in the same place forever since you think you’re perfect. Maybe what I’m talking about is overconfidence. I see way too many people saying “I’m perfect just the way I am” and I’m not sure if that’s a good thing.

“She told me it was just a game
And like a fool i played the fiddle
She told me hush as if it was sane
And followed the steps again
Touch me here i touch you there
Kiss me on the lips
Warning signs would blare
Yet i swallow my pride in sips
Others approached my broken soul
To repeat the same tips
And like a fool I played the fiddle
And let my innocence start to whittle
Down the slope again.
I started to believe the horrid deeds
That it was all a game
I kissed and kissed till i found out that its
A darken lane
That i followed when i was told
That it was all a game

I was told it was a game when I was 8.
I was told it was secret and not to tell anyone.
I was kissed and touched down below and thought it was a game
Why was I such a stupid fool and listened. I was kissed by other people. I kissed other people who knew of the game. Finding out at 11 what really was happening was horrid. I was molested... touched by her. I kissed other people and welcomed it thinking i was cool and popular they would tell me where to touch them, then they would touch me I didnt like it.. yet i feel guilty .

And now that i woke up already and have nothing to do, i'm just going to tell what happened that probably caused it.

I'm at my grandma's farm giving support and company to her and my father, since my grandpa died a few days ago.

I slept on the couch (because it's big and the only place that i could sleep without my back hurting for the next 2 days) and woke up at 3 AM to get a cup of water, hearing a few weird noises but hey, i'm on a farm right? So i go back to sleep.

I know it's irrational, but the thing is, i'm a bit anxious, and a bit paranoid, so those noises probably increased the chances of the event occurring.

I had a lucid dream, one thing that i love and hate at the same time, love because, well, it's a lucid dream, freedom, after all, but hate because it lasts 2 minutes and then it goes all wrong.

With ""goes all wrong"" i mean that most of the times i have a lucid dream, it suddenly turns into a fucking horror movie from one second to another.

In the dream, i'm at my street, just walking peacefully, i look at the alley on my right and there is a figure, just standing there, menacingly, it was fucking terrifying, it was tall, like 8-10 ft, and i could barely see it because of the dark, but still, for some reason, terrifying, i ran to the nearest door and tried to open it.

And then it happens. I wake up, but can't say anything, can't move, only see, amazing. But as i said before, i had a lot of those already, so it lasted like 10-15 seconds and then i actually woke up, cold like ice, but woke up.

TL;DR: heard weird noises at 3 AM and had a lucid dream, wich probably caused the sleep paralysis, and now i'm here",non-suicide

I was diagnosed with it when I was 11, and I haven’t felt happy since that time. I’m bullied at everything I do, even at the things I used to love, like gaming and music. When I was 4, my dad died of brain cancer. It was hard for me, but I pushed through the pain. But this year, it all came back. Everyday at school, I’m bullied because of this reason. Anytime I make friends, it blows up in my face, and I get beat up. A few weeks ago, we had a day where everyone could get in comfortable clothes, and watch a movie in the auditorium. We were allowed to bring a blanket and pillow. I brought a blue blanket, and a pillow made out of my dads shirt. It also had some text of his last words and his last heartbeats, I would send a picture if I could, but I decided to bring that. It was a big mistake. When we got in the auditorium, I settled down in the corner. I was fine for now, but then the kids that bully me came. They asked what the pillow was, and they all laughed. They took it away and ripped it up. Right then and there, something changed, part of my soul was lost, just like the pillow. I turned around and there was a pair of razors. I grabbed one and sliced one of the kids arms. They all ran away, but then the teachers came. They were running at me, and something in my mind said “do it now” so I did. I slit my neck. I felt pain, and then just everything going dark. I woke up to my mom screaming at me but I didn’t care. I wish they would have let me bleed out. But now its time for real. At least I think. I really want to die, but I everyone is keeping a close eye on me, and I’m keep being sent to mental hospitals. Please help me Reddit. Help me change whatever I’m thinking of doing and hurry.

The dream is out of order so I'm saying it in the order shit happened

I was in the house a house id moved out of 6 years ago in the living room where I just murdered a girl in my class i used to have a crush on 2 years ago. I don't recall how I actually murdered her, she was dead though. Body was purple and covered with orange and red wounds. Her intestines were sticking out her right breast for some reason. I saw them and I took a section of intestine and tore it in half, and proceeded to take a small mouse and shove it on the intestine. The girl wasn't dead, however, she sobbed softly. 

Now I'm back in the car, and this other car is behind me going fast. 

Yknow how sometimes in dreams you can see things in another building even though you're in a completely different place? That happened.

A group of girls I know we're all in a black car chasing me. And I was going fast too but i guess not enough.

For some reason i stop and jump out the car and start running inhumanly fast. The girls couldn't catch up, and were also out of the car.

Then i remember doing parlour, it felt like i was, although i was just running in between very narrow spaces in between buildings of a town I think i remember. The girls had now catched up to me. The moment one lays a hand on me in back in my childhood house.

Then I'm back in my house panicked and pacing. I go get a knife and stick in right in my addamsapple. The knife sunk like a 1000 degree knife going into a cake. With blood waterfalling down my body. I dropped.

The last thing i remember us all the girls celebrating by texting each other.

But we both have depression.
And it's been getting harder to fucking fight it every day. We tried to kill ourselves in February. When it didn't work we promised we'd try harder and not get to that point again. And yet here we are.
I've been slipping for a long time. I've relapsed on cutting myself and burning my skin, just to feel something to escape my head I can't take it anymore my dreams are scaring me and I can't tell her about them and the meds aren't working and I can't tell her about that and the coping skills aren't working and I can't fucking tell her.
We just keep feeding off each other's pain. I just want to go away so she won't keep hurting when I'm hurting. We're too empathetic with each other.

I want to kill myself soon. So that she can move on. I'm weighing her down, I'm just making her own mental health worse and I can't be strong enough for the both of us, and it's clear that she's not strong enough for us either. But it's always bad, and neither of us want to fight. She too afraid of trying pills again.

But I have so many tempting pills in my drawer. Such evil, bliss. I want to die. I'm tired, and I want to let everything go on without me.

201504,"Suicide is painless.I don’t know if anyone on here would even realize those are song lyrics, but they are.  I’m mostly going to ramble, I’d highly suggest ignoring me.

My husband accidentally killed himself on 6 September 2017.  The term accidental suicide is a ‘funny’ one, but that’s what it was.  Before that, everything was great.  Suicide, for me, hasn’t been an option since I found out I was pregnant with my first daughter.  And I found that out two months after a very long hospital and ICU stay after my last attempt.   I wasn’t ready for a marriage, and sure as hell not a kid, two months after I almost died, but it’s what I got.  And suicide hadn’t been an option since.

Until now.  And then it’s still not.  My head is such a mess of a place, one minute I need to be here and take care of our kids and the next minute I need to be as far away from those girls so they have as good of life as possible.  Preferably dead.  But then I think about God (yes I’m spiritual, please don’t atheist at me and I won’t preach at you) and how if suicides really do go to hell then I can’t off myself on purpose and go be with my husband.  But then, what if it doesn’t matter it was an accident and then he’s in hell anyway.  I’d rather be down there with him, then again, it’s hell, so I doubt I’d be able to see him anyway.  So then I have to do the what dreams may come route, get lucky, die randomly and hopefully painlessly, and then go save him.  But I doubt it works like that either.

Everyone talks about the dreams they have about their lost love ones, or his mom talks good things happening in her life.  She said she was talking to him the other day about how she needed to mow her yard, but she was just too tired.  The next day someone from the church called and asked if they could come do it for her.  
I haven’t had any of that.  I haven’t had any dreams about you and I haven’t had any good that makes me feel like you care.  I’ve had nothing.  Why haven’t I had anything?  Why don’t I matter at al.

I totally realize I switched who I was talking to there, but I’m too lazy to go back and fix it all.  And so then I don’t think about death, because why kill my self being upset about a guy who didn’t care about taking care of me or our two kids.  

And then I think about how if I’m so awful I couldn’t save their dad that night, then they probably don’t need me either.  And they’d be better off.  

Thinking hurts.  I wish there was a way we could turn our brains off and relax and breathe.  I think there would be less death then. ",suicide

201511,"Lingering thoughts.I might as well do it, suicide, because there is honestly nothing for me to gain,or lose, in this world.

My grades have gone to shit due to me slacking and putting work off till the last minute. I'm struggling to pay attention and staying focused on what ever I'm doing. 

I overthink every situation I put myself in. It's now a tendency to hurt myself and my feelings because I keep overthinking about it. I feel like I have strained my relationship with my best friend, but he says it's fine. But I can't accept it, it's not fine. ITS NEVER FINE. Why does he freaking choose to be my friend, I have been nothing more than shit and a downer. I don't deserve all my ""friends"" attention and sympathy. It's just a waste, just like myself. 

I am mentally struggling with myself- I'm trying to find out who I am, and trying to find out what people see in me. In this mess we call [Freklot]. - and I am so dependent on people that with out attention I'm lost. 

When I'm alone I feel worthless and lonely. I feel like my presence is not needed and that everything would do well without me - because no one ever asks me for anything, I have to force my presence to be acknowledged- and that no one will notice me disappearing. I feel like I'm just here to bring everyone down and that no one actually cares about me.

 I am so close to persuading myself that I actually don't have any friends, and that they're just being there to be nice to me. 

In this world I feel alone. In this world I feel worthless. In this world I am torn. I'm probably better of dead. Because hell is already where I'm 'predestined' to go, because I am gay, and that's where all abominations go. Right?

201513,"I found out i friend of mine is kind of in this church with a bunch of weird stuff going on. Ok so i'll try and keep this simple. 

I was talking to a classmate of mine that i'm close with. When they suddenly brought up religion. They continued to talk about their religion and i was doing what any normal person who didn't want to seem rude nodded along and asked questions.  I ended up asking where the church was. And they told where. I was like 'oh thats near my sports club' and proceed to open my laptop and try and search where the church was (to see how close it was too my club). When they suddenly got defensive and were like don't search up the church. I was 'sorry'. And left it at that. They continued to talk about they church and even went as far as to say 'oh i know this is going to sound like a cult'. I had no idea what they meant at the time. 

Anyway the talked for a long time. I'm pretty sure i was being recruited or whatever, they tried to invite me but i politely declined as i had no interest in joining a religion. 

So finally the conversation ended. And at the end of the day i was sitting at my laptop and remembered how weird the conversation was. I then decided to search the church up i was confused as to why they got defensive. 

So when i did it, came up with shit and a MOTHERFUCKING CULT. There are stories of people who got out of it from 1970 up until 2015. There were weird archives stuff. News reports. Stories about child abuse. Shit was crazy. 

But seriously i have no idea whether i should bring it up to them or not. They are really conservative no social media, extracurriculars, who they can talk to. Because i'm kind of worried for them.

It feels like my whole life has been such a waste. I made mostly no friends through my school years, got above average grades until I got to the end of high school and failed almost all my courses. Because of that im a butt ton of credits short from finishing. I think it was the pressure to go to university just because its university , even though I didn’t want to. At the time I wanted to do something in art but everyone kept saying ill make no money and that I have to extra talented to actually make it. I guess it didn’t really help that I felt the stupid, quiet kid with no friends at the time. I want to talk to my parents about it but the last time I did, I feel like they didn’t really listen and all they was sent me to a therapist to deal with it so they didn’t have to. I could also talk to my sister but to be honest she feels more like a stranger since she always busy with her boyfriend and university homework. The other day I tried to talk to her while she playing video games with her boyfriend but it felt like she wanted me to leave. Maybe it was my fault she didn’t want me there since they were having their personal time together. It just feels like she only reason she sees me once in a while is to feel better about herself. I mean who else wouldn’t feel better about themselves after seeing a high school dropout who’s complete NEET with no hobbies or talents.

So it's very often that I have political debates with my parents, and i say debates because we have like minded views, although my parents take a very strong liberal approach to ethics. The issue i have with this, and forgive me for sharing any political opinion at all, is that i believe in true gender equality. Ever since I was a small child, i saw a really big issue in the unspoken rules about what not to do to the other gender. 

Now I'm pretty sure we all know what that means, but if you don't, i mean things like ""men can't fight back against abusive women"", or ""men can't be raped but women can.""
I hate these things so much, it drives me absolutely crazy. I don't blame women at all for this, i think these are baked into society mainly from things like men can't cry, or women have to be nice. 

My main point is, these were all made by our predecessors, and in a lot of debates i have with my parents or millennial sister, it is always brought up that ""women are the only ones in danger of being raped"", and of course there are more freakish men than women, but it's not like it doesn't go both ways.

**Memories of Sexual Interactions in childhood:**

I have a memory of one interaction with a girl of 5 years of age, when I was also 5 years old or so. I don't remember much of the incident, before/after, or who started it between us... or where the adults were. I don't know why, but I just remember being naked with her, and stuff. I don't remember what all we did, how we knew to do anything, or anything else. 


There are also three other instances that I can remember between the ages of 5 - 10 with other children my age. Those other ones, I can remember that I believe that I instigated those ones, and they were not intense at all. Nothing really happened, at all. Like, as far as I can remember, the worst one was slapping a girl's butt when she had her pants down (she pulled them down herself, not me in this instance). 


I don't know why, but I remember feeling very sad from the ages of like... well time period of 1st grade to 7th grade. I remember it built up to it's worst around 6th grade, when I got so sad that I would cry myself to sleep and want to kill myself. I don't remember why or having a reason for it, and I have no idea about it. Until recently, I had brushed it off or actually forgotten about it, and never talked to anyone about it. 

**Guilty over sexuality:**

I remember feeling guilty about having so many sexual fantasies about people I knew I shouldn't. Like my Mother, Aunt, Teachers, or people outside of my age group. Usually older women, but I guess that I felt guilty about all sexual feelings until I was 16. Mainly, I wanted these feelings to stop or to not feel attracted to all the adults who I thought of as good people, but I couldn't help it. 


I also remember that when I discovered erotica and porn, within around a month or so I couldn't really enjoy the ""normal stuff"" in that area. At first it was just like... erotica or ""doujins"" (aka Japanese comics with nudity and sexual themes. Often involving two men, although I didn't really know why? I thought I was a straight guy, but I liked thinking of myself as the girl sexually or like being a woman, but I hated everything masculine, masculinity in general, and myself as a man. I thought everyone did, and hated all male traits I had, and didn't really find men attractive..?). But then, it all went to like BDSM (Mainly, I thought of myself from the sadistic pov until age 18 or 19, then I went super masochistic and got depressed outside of sexual themes as well, but I feel unable to stop being either S or M. I have to be one or the other...?), abusive stuff, or just odd fetishes. I felt really bad about it all, but it was like I couldn't enjoy normal things at all. Also, when I was into like doujins or guy x guy stuff, I also... like put stuff in my butt even though I didn't have a concept for ""anal"" or sex at all, I just kinda looked at the screen and saw a guy sleeping with a guy, or a guy with a girl, and I thought I wanted to be the girl and I don't know? It just like came to me or I did it and yeah I have no idea. I ended up eventually forgetting about it and just being into women for many years, like until I was 19 or 20. I hated everything masculine like I said, but then later on years later I've dropped that... like weird hatred for men, and I can see why people like being guys now, and I don't hate myself for being male that much anymore, but it's not fully right yet. I used to idealize women or think they were perfect, for a long time as well. 


I also have always been afraid of true love or thought it wasn't for me. I have no hope of ever being able to be in a genuine, regular loving relationship. I feel that is impossible for me. I want it often or... I mean I really really really like cheesy romantic films and books, but I feel like I don't deserve it. I feel worthless or unattractive or awful. I feel like the only way anyone will ever love me is if I let them hurt me or if they want to abuse me. 


&amp;nbsp;

**Memories of Sexual Interactions in childhood v2 &amp; Abusive Fantasies/Problems:**

Outside of that... I also remember being aroused around my cousin (age.... 4 - 7?) when I was younger (age 8-10?). I don't know why and I felt really guilty and bad, but one time my Aunt put her on my lap and I got like really turned on and a hard on and I felt so embarrassed and bad, and I don't think anyone saw, but I still feel bad. I don't know if that counts as abusing her, I didn't touch her or do anything else, I just don't know. Years later when I was maybe 14 - 18 and she was 7 - 10, I still had another moment of feeling attracted to her or something. I hated it the whole time, but it was... I don't know, I didn't understand or see any reason for me to feel attracted to her. I don't physically even LIKE children, how can anyone find them attractive? I don't. But yet, I still got aroused in situations around her, even though I don't find her body attractive or the idea of abusing a child attractive (it makes me feel sick or like vomiting, actually). 


In addition, I have another cousin who I had a similar thing with, where I felt like random moments of very very very very inappropriate sexual attraction or desire to do things, with no explanation. I don't like children physically, I'm not lying about this. I legitimately would not ""get off"" on seeing any child nude, I would feel sick to my stomach. However, this feeling still happens in these situations. I've even come close to like... bad things, as in like I was in the car with my cousin (4 - 8) while I was (15-18), and I had to resist not touching her arm or leg too long whenever I had to for whatever normal reason. I didn't find her attractive, want to hurt her, or have any reason for it. Yet, I still had trouble not doing more, and I feel so sick thinking about it and I hate it all. 


Outside of children, I also pretended to be a woman online various times, to hurt men. I wasn't sexually attracted to men at all at the time still, but I guess... I was jealous of women or femininity, and I really hated myself and hated male-ness. I guess I was sad when I would ask men to hurt themselves for me (claiming to be a dominant woman), and I would almost feel as much pain as they would, I didn't enjoy hurting them, but yet I did it multiple times. I felt like I was ""confirming my beliefs"" that ""women have it easier in the world, being male is inferior/worse to being female, and that males are disgusting"". This all stopped around age 18. 


&amp;nbsp; 

**Depression and Masochistic Fantasies, Suicidal urges:**

I stopped hurting people completely for like... a long time. I was crushingly depressed (and am) for the first time that I admitted it to myself, and told others or tried to seek help for the first time. So for the last 2-3 years (18 - 20) I have been really, really depressed. I feel I deserve hurt or abused, I feel worthless, and I hate myself. I have sort of totally swapped on those negative or abusive thoughts I held towards others from ages 12-18, and now have them towards myself. I would rather be abused than to abuse anyone else, and I truly feel I deserve it. I feel like from ages 6-12 I was the same way I am now, hence being sad and crying and feeling depressed. What changed that? At age 10 - 12 I had a major disease and surgery, and I think around that time something changed or I turned cold, and became more abusive or hurtful towards others, and blocked out all my emotions/pain inside.

**Other details:**

There are a lot of details missing here. Like, my Mom and Dad always argued, yelled, often screamed in each others faces, went around the house slamming things, threw things, and other stuff. I wasn't beaten as a child that I remember, but I was sometimes put in ""timeout"" for around an hour or a long long time. I remember feeling so alone in my room or feeling like I was never going to be ungrounded. I would sit in my room and feel at first impatient to get out, then slowly I would try to calm myself and say to wait, that I would wait until they came in to get me and it would be over. But I would wait and wait, and as time went on I actually lost the anger or impatience to get out of timeout, but rather I became like... sad or kind of numb or hopeless to get out? That sounds really dramatic, I don't know why I worded it that way. I eventually would get up and go out to ask to get out, or to talk about it, because I really felt like it was never going to end. But my parents would always say that ""timeout was JUST about to end, that it was like 29 minutes in, and they were planning to let me out after 30, so I had to go back for another 15). I just remember that happening a lot, like.... a ton of times. I remember them promising to talk to me, to discuss/debate about whatever fight happened that caused me to be put into timeout, and stuff like that... after I would get out of timeout. But inevitably, everytime I got out of timeout they would either say we weren't going to talk about it at all and forbade me from talking about it (or I would be put back into timeout), or they would tell me to be quiet and only say their opinion or side of the story, and I was unable to say what I felt or thought happened. 


I also remember always being afraid of the dark and especially footsteps at night. I sat awake in my room a lot of times as a child that I can remember, always looking down the hallway or feeling like a person was going to come into my room and get me. I had this one instance where I was awake and conscious looking down the hall, and this big black dog appeared and ran at me, and jumped. I was really afraid and threw my hands up, but the dog vanished or seemed to disappear right as it jumped at me. I didn't know if it was a ghost or a dream or something, but it always bothered me. I still have this paranoia or fear of intruders in my room, although it isn't all the time or every night. It's only maybe a few times a week or month, but I get so paranoid and I can't stop checking corners that I have already checked, and I feel very unsafe or that I am in mortal danger. It only happens from like 12 AM - 5AM when everyone is asleep, usually. It happened sometimes even when I did temporarily move out to other places, but was much less frequent. It happens a lot more frequently in my bedroom that I have had since I was a child. 

In school and outside with other children, I remember being bullied or made fun of all the time by almost everyone. There were times where I remember lashing out, or being a bully as well though. Like, especially from ages 6 - 10 I had a lot of issues in school. I remember being mean to a few people or lying or stealing, which is so weird. As I got older, I am probably the most open &amp; honest person I know. That isn't a humble brag, I legitimately cannot lie now even if I want to, or like... I talk too much or tell people everything. I am unable to keep a secret or lie or deceive anyone, and I HATE lying. I consider it to be like the worst thing in the world, so thinking of how I am then is so strange. Plus, although I still struggle with the random, weird, desires to abuse other people, I mainly never want to see anyone else hurt and I try very hard to not judge others. I try to look at things from everyone's point of view, and I forgive everyone even if they hurt me. I remember apologizing just two years ago to a friend who told me to kill myself and was being emotionally abusive, but she still ended up blocking me after I was trying to apologize to her (she started to tell me to kill myself and that kind of thing because I told her I think I might be LGBTQ, and she said she had liked me...? But I was really blind previously and hadn't noticed she liked me, and I never hurt her). So it's like in the past I was a bad child at times, but somewhere it all changed and I became like... I guess more open &amp; honest &amp; caring about others than most of my peers. Like in University, I've been told a lot that I think too much, and sometimes that I care too much about other people (both in the ""what they think about you"" way, and the ""some people are assholes, you shouldn't trust everyone as much as you do"" way). I can't seem to not trust or love other people, even if they are repeatedly assholes or do bad things, it's like I feel that deep down they aren't bad people no matter what they do?


I also know my parents did a lot of drugs (well, mainly my dad, my mom did too, but not as much). Not just Marijuana, but like painkillers or LSD or MDMA or Downers. My Dad is really into Downers, and he always had a lot of friends over to do stuff with, watch car shows, play games, and hangout. They all stopped coming over when I was around 6-10 though, I don't know what really happened or why my Dad stopped hanging out with his friends. 



My Dad was physically and emotionally abused by his Dad growing up (as well as witnessing his sister being raped by her babysitter, but he didn't know what it was at the time or was too young to help/understand), and my Mom was sexually abused by her Uncle growing up, also for reference.


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


**Conclusion:**

Okay, that was a huge wall of information. The point is that I get so depressed or down and feel I am worthless, deserve abuse, and hate myself. I do self harm, and I do drugs, and I seek out others to hurt me. I don't know how to stop or how to work on it, I've started to see a therapist ~3 weeks ago, but so far it's like.... she has to learn so much about me before she can fully help, and I don't know if she will be able to help. I'm afraid to tell her of my abusive times towards others, because I feel so guilty of them. I have told her about most of the other stuff, but I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't be an adult and be independent, find a loving relationship, or succeed in life. I feel like I will always be someone who hurts others or fails and an embarrassment, and I don't know what to do. ",suicide

Nothing that I do these days will give me a life worth being proud of, I should have done things right when I had the chance.

201574,"Advice on personality Hello! I would like to ask the kind denizens of r/teenagers some questions regarding personality. I've had a rough time these past few years struggling with emotional numbness, and I'm anxious that it's had a negative effect on my personality. Things I believe it has affected are my motivation (which has made me a lazy prick who takes the path of least resistance almost all of the time), charisma (which has made me a very dull person to talk to as I cannot really relate to others problems or acheivements in a meaningfull way) and has dampened my will to help in a selfless way (I don't get any emotional reward from doing a good deed anymore, so it is harder to help others.) I feel jaded by it all, and can't for the life of me truly care for anything. I'm aware that some of these things are typically associated with autism, or other ailments on the autism spectrum like Asperger's, and I have formal letters from my therapist attesting to me being autistic. However, these traits never have been as strong as they are now. Is this normal? What advice would you give to someone in my position?",non-suicide

201617,"I'm a 26-year-old virgin because of religious upbringing, abandoned by my father, never went to college because I devoted my life to my church, jealous of my more successful brother. I feel so lost. I feel like I have so much going against me.I'm sorry but my post might be all over the place. I grew up with an abusive father who used to beat me, but my father was always kind to my younger brother (3 years younger). When I turned 8 years old my father abandoned my family for another woman. My mother joined a church for emotional support and since then I was raised in a super religious upbringing.

This church turned out to be a cult. We had to distance from friends and family. They shamed people for having sex before marriage. They hammered the idea into out heads that planet earth was overrun by spiritual demons, they are in our rooms and everywhere, and we should avoid sin because we will go to hell. And they went really far to make us literally fear going hell every single moment. They would make us envision hell, make us watch documentaries of people that went to hell, show us paintings of hell. Taught us to fast (not eat) often as it would bring us closer to God. We weren’t allowed to watch movies, tv or cartoons/anime or listen to music (unless they were Christian), read non-christian books, comics, etc. Encourage parents/kids to not join school activities like sports, clubs, school dances because they have temptations of sins. The church also encourages us to not go to college because college is a place of sin and to devote our lives to the church after high school and get regular jobs.

Before I knew it my mom and myself became indoctrinated. I was already a loser in school growing up but now I was an even bigger loser because now I was the annoying Christian kid preaching to everyone. My brother didn’t buy the church stuff, he rebelled against my mother's teachings, and he ended up reconnecting with my dad and moving in with my dad. My dad didn’t want anything to do with me, he only wanted my brother. My dad said I'm the son he never wanted. My brother went on to become popular at his school, normal dating life, and eventually went to college.

After I graduated high school, I devoted my life to the church. I got a job at a factory and became a youth leader at my church. When I was 19 I started to become close friends with this girl at my church. Eventually, we started dating and we dated for 6 years. We never had sex, and barely kissed, the most we did was handhold or cuddle. When I was 25 years old I started to have doubts about my religion, and I ended up leaving my church, since then I am no longer religious, or agnostic-atheist. My GF at the time broke up with me for leaving the church, she eventually ended up marrying a guy. Around the same time, I lost my job at the factory and have been unemployed ever since.

Since then I had a hard time adjusting to a normal life. I never went to college or had a dream of my own because of the church. I never got to have friends, go to school dances, or date like a normal person, before church made me feel so ashamed of my sexuality. I was so scared of hell and demons, I even tried not to think dirty, I was supposed to even control my thoughts until marriage. I barely masturbated, I only masturbated a handful of times as a teen, and I haven’t masturbated again till I was 25 and I still feel guilty when I masturbate.

Now I’m a 26-year-old virgin, with daddy issues who never went to college, don’t have social skills, barely any money, and no friends at all. I barely have a personality of my own because for so many years I have lived for the church and my religion. With a bad personality like mine it’s already a set back in dating, and on top of that dating is already hard enough because I’m not attractive by society standards for males. I’m 5’5 with an unattractive face and I'm balding, I would have probably been 5’11 but the doctor told me fasting so often in my teen years stunted my growth and affected my facial bone development. I mean even my Ex-Gf said to me that she would have never been attracted to me if she wasn’t part of our church but that the churches teaching allowed her to see past my looks.

So these days, I get rejected a lot, both in-person and online dating for my personality, looks or height or social status or balding, and even the few times I got lucky and a few girls who were willing to give me a chance, the moment they found out I was a virgin they just assumed something was wrong with me and shamed me for being a virgin. I spend so many years being scared of sex I would not even know how to have sex with a girl.

I just feel like I have nothing to start with. I feel like I wasted my youth, wasted my time when I could have got a head start at college, never had a dream, never had a normal childhood. Now I struggle with being a 26-year-old virgin. Recently I even gained weight, I started eating emotionally because I'm avoiding drinking or using drugs and now I'm fat. I'm also dealing with health issues that make me feel testicular and groin pain and my knees hurt which makes me unable to walk for long, and doctors can't diagnose what's wrong with me. 

I just feel the hope keeps getting deeper. When I compare my life to my brother's life who’s the same age as me, I envy him. He’s 5’11, healthy, handsome, divorced parents but still has our dad in his life, was popular in school, played sports, went to school dances, always knew what he wanted to be, graduated and went to college, had a healthy sex/dating life, never had to deal with religion and had the freedom to find himself. My brother and my mom don’t understand my feelings, and my father doesn’t care about me. When I'm around my brother I feel so much envy and emasculated, I feel like I'm less of a man.

I feel I have everything going against me, and I lost so much of my youth and have nothing to start with, and feel romantically lonely and unattractive. I honestly feel like killing myself. I thought about selling all my stuff and donating all my money to a children's charity in my area and then killing myself. I'm not religious, but I sometimes hope I can be reborn into a different life. I just hope there isn't a hell because it would really suck that after all my earthly suffering now I have to burn for eternity just because I couldn't take it anymore.",suicide

201642,"I don’t necessarily know where to rant so ig I’ll rant here Mother fucking hell. I’ve never really been “depressed” before now. Sure I got sad sometimes but until quarantine I never felt the way I do now. Nothing has any fucking meaning anymore. I’ve lost all hope and even the fact that my school will be doing a hybrid in person thing isn’t able to bring me out of it. This quarter I haven’t done a fucking single assignment and it’s going on three weeks tomorrow. I have Fs in all my classes because I just can’t fucking do them. I have no motivation whatsoever. The only sliver of joy I’ve found in the past few weeks is playing minecraft on a realm me and all my friends started. But even with that, afterwards I’m just thrown into a depressive slump again. I know that some of you might be going through this as well and fuck man I’m sorry. 

The other day was the first time I’ve ever legitimately considered suicide. The next morning I immediately dropped it and though better, but that fact is that I thought about it and that fucking scares me. What if one day I don’t shake it off? All these school assignments getting thrown at me have no value. None of the classes i’m in right now are based on subjects i’m interested in or want to make a career out of. And the one class I usually always really enjoy(history) has just lost all its charm. I can’t fucking take this anymore.

And my parents don’t help the situation either. Before quarantine I basically had free rane on my phone and how much I could talk to my friends and girlfriend. Then after quarantine my parents decided that it wasn’t cool to do that so I had to start turning my phone in every night. Ever since they’ve been putting more and more restrictions on the only shit I like to do. I’ve talked to them about it and tried to work something out but they won’t fucking listen. I feel so isolated and alone because of them and what they’re doing. I won’t go into anymore detail on what they’ve done but yeah. 

So yeah that’s pretty much it. I’m at my fucking limit and I know some of you might be too. Just hmu if you need any fucking person to talk to. Ik how lonely this can all feel and I wanna help you and i’m the process you can help me. Thank for listening to my ted talk.",non-suicide

I'm 22 and still living in my mom's basement. I've had social anxiety that started when I was 10 that just continued to get worse. I dropped out of high school because I couldn't deal with all the people there anymore. I tried going to an alternative school when I was 20 to try to finish my schooling but had the same issues even though there was only 5 other people there. I stopped going to drivers Ed because I sat in the car before class the second day crying from how stressed and anxious I was. I have no job and no job experience. I have no friends. I have no hobbies. I have no talents. I have nothing. My mom is suffering due to me. She's in her 60s and on her feet all day at work trying to make enough money. We live in a house she can't afford so that I can have a room. She buy food she can't afford so that I can eat. She buy clothes she can't afford so I can wear something. I'm just a leach. She's behind in almost all her bills and exhausted everyday because of me. I've tried putting out resumes to places, but most don't even look at it since it's so blank. I've only had one place want an interview. I could sleep at all that night worrying over it. When I got there, I wasn't even able to answer any questions. I take pills that don't help since we can't afford the ones my doctor think might. My glasses barely work because we don't have the money to get a new prescription. I've tried getting disability and was declined because it wasn't serious enough. I've tried welfare but was declined because I live with a parent. I'm just so done with it all. I'm done trying to get better. I'm done trying to help my mom out. I'm seriously thinking of selling everything I own, giving my mom the money and just killing myself.

201645,"Please read and comment if you have anything useful to addMy name is Nicki and I live in the UK.  My (and so far only) suicide attempt was 23 years ago.  What I learnt from it is that you don't attempt unless you are going to do it properly - I was hospitalised and the time I spent there was too horrific to describe.  Effectively a mandatory psych hold is a form of imprisonment, even though you have done nothing to harm anyone else. It is shocking, humiliating, frightening, degrading, and traumatic.  

I am writing this in the hope that it will progress the 'right to die', not only in the UK but all over the world.  In some countries, euthanasia is permitted but mainly for those who already have a terminal illness.   Almost every first world country now accepts as a basic human right that one has a 'right to life'.  Surely there must be a corresponding and opposite right to ""not live"" if that is what an individual chooses!?

Yes, there are socio-political issues in that if all those who are not in the 1-2% of the elite might all choose to die and then who would do the dirty work that the elite don't want to?  Some people even subscribe to the notion that you are the property of the government and therefore do not have the right to choose your fate.  Then there is the reality that, in effect, employment is modern-day slavery., albeit physically kinder.  The destructive effect of not having employment is total.  You are cut off from colleagues as a method of socialisation.   You are castigated as 'lazy'.  Your income is reduced to such an extent that survival is almost impossible.  Yet when you are employed you spend a significant amount of time and energy trying not to upset the employer for fear you might lose your job.. Either option is going to make you feel insecure and uneasy. 

There is an attempt in the UK at the moment to make mental illness less of a stigma.  Frankly, it is an embarrassment.  There have been adverts on the television showing 'politically correct' ways to approach an employee who has been off work with depression.  They are so laughably pathetic that if anyone approached me this way, I would simply laugh in their face, albeit that I would be dying inside.  If 25% of the population will suffer diagnosed mental health issues in their lifetime, wouldn't it just make sense to treat everyone normally?!  I menton diagnosed issues because there is a far greater section of the population who suffer without going to a doctor/clinician and having a formal diagnosis. 

Of course there must be some safeguards around the right to death.  One cannot simply rock up at a clinic and say ""I exercise my right to die, right now"".  The thought might be an impulse as a result of situational circumstances.  However, over the past 23 years, I have wanted to die (for the most part) continuously.  Sure there have been distractions from time to time but generally speaking, I have not been engaged and occupied by the life provided to me.   Just how long do I have to suffer before someone concludes I am serious?

The reality is that suicide attempts are either unlikely to succeed (eg overdose) or incredibly painful (jumping off a high building or in front of a train).  I had no choice as to whether I was brought into existence.   Why should I have to risk involuntary incarceration or unbearable pain in order to achieve non-existence?  Instead, I have chosen the 'slow but sure' route of neglecting my health and developing habits which supposedly will ensure I die.  What do I mean by that?  Well for the last seven years I have stopped taking medication to lower my blood pressure and cholesterol, drunk daily in excess of the weekly recommended limits of alcohol, I smoke, I eat a lot of processed and fatty foods....let me tell you that these habits, whilst I am sure they are not the best for health, do not necessarily lead to death, despite what the medical professionals say.  All that happens is that you suffer the same difficulties but with a less healthy body.  I would never have thought when I started this that I would still be alive seven years later.  In some respects jumping in front of a train would be less painful in the long run, if only I could get over the fear. 

Three months ago, I took my dog to a specialist veterinary practice to have her liver cancer staged.  She was put under anaesthetic for a CT scan and the results were that the cancer was so invasive it was deemed kinder not to wake her up.  Depression is not so very different from cancer.  It invades every aspect of your life.  Things that would make you feel pure joy are muted so that you barely smile.  Things that would be a downer to a person without depression crush you.  Everyday life is a struggle to get through.  The pressure and pain of living is very real.  Why, then, is the dog treated more kindly than the human?  

There are those that say your death would affect people who care about you.  Well if they cared that much, wouldn't they want you to be out of pain?  Wouldn't they want you not to have to struggle?  That is the argument we use when we put animals to sleep.   The human is simply another animal, albeit with self-awareness.  When will someone show mercy to the human in the same way as they do to animals?!

My second attempt doesn't feel so very far away.  However, why should I have to do this?  Why can't I, after 23 years of suffering, simply ask that I am allowed to simply go to sleep and  not wake up?  Why do I have to risk my freedom in order to achieve lasting peace? 

My greatest fear is that I will fail.  That I will be subjected to mandatory 'treatment', which consists only of depriving an individual of anything and everything that they can use to hurt themselves.  Alternatively drugging them up so much that they can't plan or activate their plan to suicide.  

I really don't know how to end this. Honestly, I just want to die...is that so unreasonable?",suicide

201647,"21M I'm lost at the momentI've been suicidal for a while but I never had the balls of committing until the past few months. Starting in October, I stopped showing up for my shit job who screws its workers over, stopped going to my university classes, and stopped answering texts, calls, and any DM's. I decided to take a trip to Denver, Colorado for some legal weed and edibles, thinking that it'll clear my mind and get rid of my life problems . It's a 20hr drive and I made it to about 12 hours in and slept overnight at a truck stop. I woke up and realized I was wasting my time, so I headed back home. I recorded a suicide video, minimally edited it, and transfered it to a USB thumb drive. After I did all thay I downed as many benadryl pills as I could. I chilled for a bit and watched some YouTube while they all dissolved. Unfortunately I ate a ""last meal"" beforehand and my stomach reacted causing me to puke. A lot. In a weird state of feeling I cleaned up everything then dozed off. Waking up to having a hard time breathing. The large amount of benadryl affected my eyes so it seemed like I had to press my phone and monitor up to my face to read anything without it being blury. The side effects lasted longer than I expected. Eventually I composed myself and cleaned up everything completely, including myself. A day or two later my mom stopped by my house with the spare key and beat on my bedroom door saying if I didn't answer that she'd call the cops since no one has head from me for a while. About an hour after she left I used the excuse of stress for my absence and wearing my headset while sleeping for not hearing her. Eventually my best friend demanded to hang out and figure out why I wasn't responding to him. Again I used excuses. But here I am, lying to my family thay I'm finishing finals in uni and finding another job. My funds are slowly dwindling and Idk what my next steps are. If I attempt suicide again I'll definitely crush them and mix them with a smoothie or something. I'm sorry for the long post but I've been lurking this sub with my main account for a while.

201657,"I need helpLike my throwaway name says, this will be a long post (and on mobile so poorly formatted).

I am 22f in a completely new city, working/studying in a completely new field for my graduate degree. My entire family lives 15 hours from me, the entirety of my friend group is 14-15 hours away (both by car, but I do not have the available time or money to fly back home due to my job constraints). This is the first time I have ever lived truly on my own. And I am not doing well.

My history with depression/anxiety started at 8. I was diagnosed after telling my parents I wanted to kill myself and telling them how I planned to do it. Between then and 2016 I’ve had 4 major suicide attempts, which my closest friends are aware of, but not my family. I regularly self-harmed through high school and my first two years of college (using fists/other hard objects to beat myself, cutting the inside of my mouth, burning the soles of my feet, picking at skin). This was purposefully never noticeable because I didn’t want anyone to know I was struggling.

Fast forward to recent years and to now: between 2016-2018 I was doing well, I managed to stop self-harming and was without suicidal ideation. I loved my friend group, I loved my therapist, I was excelling in school. I feel as though since I moved several months ago everything has fallen apart. Let me unpack it all.

My final year of college was difficult. I entered a very unhealthy relationship that was centered on gaslighting and emotional manipulation lasting from September to this past August 11mo). During this relationship, in March, I was sexually assaulted by a close friend while I slept. He pulled up my shirt and pulled down my pants and removed my tampon and inserted his fingers inside of me. I fully believe that if I had not woken up he would have raped me. The shame that I felt from this was unbearable because I believed it must have been my fault. I agreed to sleep in his bed as it was raining and late and I didn’t feel safe walking back to my house. I felt I would be safe with him. Ironic, no? I did not report my assault to my school, police, or parents. I did not have a rape kit done. I told my boyfriend at the time, who told me that no one would believe it, that there wasn’t evidence, that somehow the assault would be pinned on me. So I told no one else.

In light of the Kavanaugh confirmation bringing sexual assault to the forefront of US news, I have felt intense anguish, grief, anger, and disgust towards the man who assaulted me and towards myself. I feel I am reliving my assault every time I hear about someone else’s. I have multiple times wanted to tell someone else, to hear them say they support me, but feel as though I can’t. I have close friends who were raped. To me this feels as though it is not something I should be this upset by, as it could have been much worse. I know it doesn’t make sense, it’s just the way it feels. What’s more is that I’m still afraid I won’t be believed or will be blamed. Or that someone will force me to report something I don’t want to see dragged open with lawyers and police and a school investigation. For some people that would give closure. For me that idea gives me nightmares.

The other challenge I am facing is that I am entering into an entirely new field of work/school. I feel incompetent. I know I was brought on by the board head specifically for my knowledge, but I have fucked up again and again, and the work that I have produced is sloppy and slow to come. I am TERRIFIED that I am a complete disappointment. The email I received today after I accidentally destroyed important data confirms that fear. I’ve only just started, and I do genuinely love the work, but I’m already a failure. My anxiety over destroying my future career and degree has amplified significantly in the two months I’ve been working to the point I’m vomiting most mornings and have relapsed HARD into self-harm. While I’ve never broken a bone from beating myself, I certainly came close today.

I am afraid of what will happen to me as I continue to get deeper into my career. I don’t have time or energy to participate in the activities I love outside of working. The atmosphere is very much get ahead by any means and I don’t feel I have time to meaningfully connect with my peers or coworkers. I have an appointment made with a new psychiatrist and counselor here (I am already on an extremely high dose of SSRIs which have for the most part worked long term after getting dosing right in late high school/early college), and was open with my referring (new) doctor which is a big step for me, but I do not think I will keep myself from lying to my counselor and psychiatrist when I meet with them. I do not want to be hospitalized. I would have to leave work/school. My parents would know. I’m not sure whether they would be devastated or appalled. Probably both.

I can’t even kill myself here but I want to. My student loans from undergraduate will roll over to my parents. And my life insurance policy would be voided if I committed suicide. My parents, who have lovingly paid for everything to provide me with the best future I can have wouldn’t get a single cent. I cannot destroy their lives in an effort to stop mine from hurting.

I miss my friends. I miss my family. I miss not waking up and hating myself. I miss not crying every single morning wishing nobody was around to care or have financial burden from my death so that I could just end it. 

If I can’t die, I just want to find a way to feel ok. I just want help.",suicide

Not many people know that like I do, but it's the truth. He had it glorified in his mind.. so the part where I say ""Maybe I, or someone else, could have for that exact moment, but you would have gotten your fate the way you wanted eventually"".. it's mainly out of anger and based on the knowledge I have of how he was. So please, don't focus on that part.. anybody can change there mind about this. 




It has been three years. Three years since I’ve touched your face, three years since I’ve heard your voice, three years since I’ve been able to use any of my senses for you. 


Actually, that’s a lie. On some days, without warning, I will be lucky enough to catch your scent in the air. Before this started happening, I had no idea how powerful the sense of smell was. I become completely disoriented as soon as it happens. Sometimes, I think I may pass out. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it takes my breath away.. in a very emotionally painful fashion. 


The first thought that races through my head: He is here. I don’t know how true this thought is, because who knows if it’s possible for you to be near me after you are gone? Is it just my memory randomly pulling your scent out so intensely that I believe I actually smell it? Is your spirit beside me when it happens? Not that you’d visit me, if it is indeed possible, considering the way things between us were when you left this world. 


I like to think that you can see what I do and get in a good laugh. Boy, have I made some mistakes or what? I’m like a train wreck that happens slowly. What the fuck am I doing? You’d think that you and I were happily married, with a full life ahead of us, the way I took the tragedy. Shit, maybe that would have been easier. I completely shut down. I felt like I didn’t deserve to feel anything, considering we were barely on speaking terms before you passed. I still feel that way, sometimes. Like your friends and family are the ones who deserve to be to hurt out loud, not me, so I keep most of my feelings tucked deep down. 


And then there’s the guilt I feel. I go back and forth on how I feel on this particular emotion. Some days, I am just guilt stricken, lying in the bed, crying or sitting in silence like a mad woman. I wonder if there was anything I could have done or said to change your fate. What if I had stuck around, toughed out the hard times? Would that have even mattered? What if I had called you that night? Would I have been able to change your mind? Did I even possess the power to do something like that, or am I over exaggerating how important I was to you in my mind? I like to believe that maybe, just maybe, I could have made a difference for that particular night; but that’s just my ego. I know deep down that nothing could have changed your mind. Maybe I, or someone else, could have for that exact moment, but you would have gotten your fate the way you wanted eventually. Or maybe that's what I tell myself to keep the guilt from rearing it's nasty head.

 
Other days, I am livid. I am pissed as fuck at you for being so selfish. How dare you take it upon yourself to take your life? Did you not realize how that would affect everybody you loved and that loved you? Did you think nobody would care? Or maybe you were just too fucked up to even consider us. I hate you for it. I want a miracle to happen that allows me to see you one last time, just so that I can beat you until you are dead again. I believe this is referred to as the anger step in grief. I’ve noticed that I don’t follow those steps correctly. I do hit most of them, at some point. I never bargained. Maybe I never did because I’m not particularly religious, or because your death was sudden and I had no time to before it. In any case, I’ve hit depression and anger the most.

 
One day, I hope to see you again. I don’t really even care what the outcome of our encounter would be. Maybe you would be at peace and realize that we were young and stupid, and forgive me for all I did.. abandoning you and moving on from the maddness ; then maybe I could forgive you for taking your life, and for all the pain you caused me while you were alive. Maybe you would be the same selfish dick as you were once before, and will tell me that the way I reacted over this tragedy was ridiculous, and that I shouldn’t have held on to nothing for as long as I did; that you never cared about me. Either way, at least I would have closure and be satisfied. Pain from a broken heart is better than the pain caused by not having any answers. 


I sincerely hope this hits someone in the feels. This started as one girl's attempt to let go of rage and guilt, but maybe it can be more. Life is good, people. It's the only thing we do. Just live. Life can be beautiful if you let it.

   Also, I’m about to be very honest because I feel I have nothing to lose! I really don’t want to upset or burden anyone with my problems.
   
   I’ve been especially suicidal this past month and I feel as if I’m slowly going deeper into this...empty void. I can’t even collect thoughts properly. It’s taking me forever to even type this. I feel very slow physically and intellectually.  As a result I’ve been calling out of work a lot, which is also adding to the shame. 

   Even worse, I work with my dad. I don’t want to give away too many details but we’re waiters, pretty much. My dad is one of those parents who mean well, but is a “pull up your bootstraps” kinda guy. Seeking help from him in the past has pretty much been a slap to the face. He once told me, “Well, if it’s really so bad you could always kill yourself”. 

   Oh man. That rings in my head every day. 

   So I’ve been very serious about finally working up the courage to end it. I’ve fantasized about it since I was like 14. I’m pretty well educated by now from years of google searching. Either the exit bag technique or short drop hanging.

    Long story short, I found out about the helium shortage, and needing 98-99% purity, blah blah blah. So, I was even more frustrated and upset that my options were narrowing; I just slung a belt and a robe tie over a door, attached it to the handle, and put as much pressure on my carotid artery as I could. 

   It totally was working, but as things became a bit fuzzy and numb I had this sudden thought of my boyfriend coming home. The image that flashed through my head of him in anguish over what I’d done roused me like an electric shock. Holy shit, I panicked. The haphazard noose I made was very effective at tightening and being difficult to undo. I was barely able to slip a finger in and get out.

   It left me pretty shaken, honestly. I’d almost done it. If I’d taken the time to tie my hands I’d be dead. It was literally the love I have for the guy is what saved me. He’s is in a really poor place mentally too and I didn’t want to abandon him.

   I sort of decided that I need to try one last time to really truly seek help; try meds if I have to. I wanna try for him. 

   Now I’m at a complete impasse. I have insurance but it only covers ONE facility. It has TERRIBLE ratings and reviews and when I called, the lady was very cold and told me she could fit me in, in 4 months. WTF I can’t wait 4 months. I’ve had a complete breakdown and I can’t even go to work because of the unrelenting sobbing and headaches. 

  So I tried looking for something out of network but I have NO IDEA where to start. Crazy expensive too! I have an extreme fear of doctors in general too, so there’s an added layer of anxiety. 

   If I go to the hospital I will lose my job and will be left destitute and demoralized. I lose my insurance at 26 too so long-term treatments seem pointless. 

  What do I do? It seems impossible to get help and I’m getting discouraged that it’s even possible to be fixed.


  

   Thank you to anyone who took the time to read. I have no friends because I’ve isolated myself very effectively and I don’t have any family to turn to for help. I feel like a child that is confused, upset, and crying out for someone’s help.",suicide

201670,"Really struggling with life (life story)I've been struggling with depression / anxiety for a couple years now. Its been something that's very on / off for me. Which has impacted many parts of my life but mostly academics. 
I'm 17 years old, turning 18 soon. I'm a senior in high school, very above average intelligence, naturally good looking, funny. I've always struggled with social skills (diagnosed with Asperger's several years ago), I never really took interest in socializing, only my limited interests. 
Computers have always been apart of who I am, and growing up, I realized that I rarely shared interests with others and began to isolate myself even more. 
My family used to mean a lot to me. I was always a very sensitive kid and relied on my mom for support. My dad however, always had been kind of a dick, especially to my mom and I. Know that i'm older, I now know he has Asperger's worse than I do and has trouble expressing emotions.
Right around early middle school is when I really felt like my life was going down hill. My parents without warning were getting divorced, the kids in middle school were always so mean to me and I got picked on a lot, and I started realizing the group of friends I had didn't really like me that much.
In retrospect, I feel like the emotions I had during the long, agonizing divorce never really were taken care of. I no longer had anyone to go to as a support, and that transition time period was very sensitive. My mom had been too busy with her new boyfriend (which didn't take long to get), who had been one of my old friend's dad. That made things pretty terrible at school, especially living in a small, very conservative town. This was a very rough time in my life. 
High school came around, things seemed to get even worse. I got bullied more and more, I was suicidal, failing classes, horribly depressed (partly from side effects of medication). By the time my junior year came around, I was just starting to take my life in control when I decided to make a huge fucking mistake. 
I was with a group of ""friends"" at the time, when I thought it would be cool to show off how I can hack into our teacher's email account. As a group, we all took turns writing parts of a terrible and derogative email which we sent out to the school district. Pretty fucking hilarious at the time until eventually enough people at my school told the police it was me (without even knowing f or certain), so that they investigated me and of course I broke under questioning. This resulted in my expulsion at my first high school. The other guys got off completely free because they blamed it all on me. I almost faced a felony, but got lucky with a judge. This process was also very long and agonizing.
I got accepted into another public high school shortly after, in which I decided to turn my life around and give an effort with my life. I proved this with getting a 4.0 GPA and earned several very difficult computer certifications. My self esteem at this high school was improving as well as I learned that a lot of girls actually thought I was attractive and funny (I'm completely clueless). I plan on going into the computer field in college, something that I'm gifted in. 
Recently however, things have started to go down hill again. I was tired of my dad being such a dick to me so I moved out of his house, currently living at my moms. I got into drugs for a little bit, especially over the summer. I thought I was too smart to get any of the side effects, but my newly gained social life started slipping, as well as emotional connections with family. However, I have stopped, even with smoking recently. Now that i'm sobering up, I'm realizing again what a mess my life is, makes it even more tempting to go back.
Today, I got called down to the principals office at my tech center (i'm dual enrolled in a public high school and vocational education). Apparently they found a text file on my school computer that I don't even remember writing that said some stupid shit. And they said that I could be facing expulsion again for this.
I can't handle getting fucking expelled again. If that does happen, I seriously don't think i'll be able to handle it. I was already reluctant enough about my life from the past one to take any more emotional struggle. I know for a fact that If I get expelled, I won't get anymore chances, my life will literally be over. 

So right now, I'm feeling pretty shitty towards myself for letting something like that happen a second fucking time. I've already been depressed lately, don't know what I should do :/ . I came here because I don't know where else to go to, anyone my age wouldn't help, even my girlfriend. 
Will emotional connections come back after the weed leaves my system? Will my life get any better? Do I still have a chance at being successful? I'm just so lost and confused right now, I really need help.

201672,"Turned 28 today and the lack of happy birthday messages made me realize how small my life is. It's better I don't exist anymore.Six people wished me happy birthday on facebook for my 28th birthday today. One was my mom and the other my SO, a girl with whom I've been in a long distance relationship for three and a half years.

Most normal people with a healthly level of social connections get upwards of 20 happy birthday posts.

My life is so incredibly small. I don't really exist or matter to anyone. I have no real friends. I missed out on all the fun everyone has in college due to social anxiety. 

My life has reached its low point. 28 years old with no friends, a job in which I work online and don't interact face to face with other people, and no social life.

I have had suicidal thoughts before, but today it became more real than ever. I've missed out on so much already, so many friendships and connections. They say the 20s are the most fun decade of life; mine have been marked by depression and anxiety. 

It's all downhill from here. Time to end it I think. What hope do I have? I can't see any semblance of hope in my future. Just an increasingly toxic attitude of regret and feelungs of loneliness. I'd rather be dead.

I could exercise, cook healthy food, draw more and focus better on my studies... But I’m here again, thinking about suicide and being all sad. 

There’s something I can’t take, I can’t face it off: I have no true friends. 

I mean... I have friends, but nobody would talk to me more than 1 time in the week if I don’t do it. People just don’t like me because I have a strange attitude and I’m immature. 

I really do miss a friend that talked to me for a month after a period of around a year that she did not talked to me. She told me that she really likes me as a friend, but she had reasons to stop talking to me, very deep reasons... And, she did it again. She left me, without knowing why. I’m here again, I feel worse. 

I would always listen to people’s problems, I would give them advice, I would tell them that I’d do anything for them... But anyone tells me that back. 

And... Anyone could say: Don’t worry about having no friends, that does not define you. But... Having friends mildly defines you. If you’ve got friends, you’re someone that people likes. If you don’t have friends... People does not like you. Conversations with me are uncomfortable and shitty, people just don’t like me. 

I can’t face off my poor ability to exist in a society and that’s my reason to be suicidal. I always tell people that I don’t understand why I’m i so depressed (when I have friends because that’s surely a reason nobody likes me). I’m so afraid of telling anyone about this, because it is just so DEPRESSING. It

I say that not to brag and know how blessed I am. I read about people struggling with horrible family, financial or health issues and try to get some perspective to my problems but it's just not working. My issues are peanuts compared to most people and I wish my brain would understand that fact.

I'm upper middle class, amazing wife, great kids but the pressure is just unbearable. My company went through a restructuring last year and my take home pay was severely reduced while health insurance went way up. I tried to talk to my wife about how dramatically this would affect our lifetstyle and she understands but doesn't want to make the necessary sacrifices.

Long story short, we've burned through most of our savings (save my 401k) and are living paycheck to paycheck. This started my downward spiral into anxiety and depression.

What exaggerated it was problems at work that are out of my control but could soon cost me my job. Even worse, I may soon find myself in some legal trouble (nothing criminal just civil) that most likely won't result in anything other than more financial issues. My wife is supportive and I know if the worst happened she'd still be there but my anxiety and fear are all consuming and lately I've been having suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life.

My wife wants me to see a therapist but I'm afraid and ashamed. It just feels like this elephant on my chest is never going to go away and honestly I'm tired of fighting it.

I don't care about the money, I grew up dirt poor and could go back to it tomorrow, but my wife came from privilege and my kids have never wanted.  I don't know how I can face them when it all goes down.

201697,"Two more failed attempts this weekend. I'm at the end of my rope and I'm scared.I've been in a very bad place for years, but I feel like I'm nearing the bottom now.

I have schizophrenia and DID, and I've never been able to get real help. In high school, it was because of my living situation with my parents. I always told myself that once I got to college, I'd be able to immediately get help, and that everything would be okay. I lost count of the times that I attempted during my senior year, but ultimately that thought - that I could eventually get better, and that it would just be another year - got me through it.

But now I'm in college, and I still can't do anything. I'm on my parents' medical insurance, which makes it so that I have no way of secretly getting help. My parents are abusive, but I rely on them to survive. I don't have any other source of income because as a severely disabled (and highly unstable) person I haven't had any luck getting a job. I don't even know if I'd be able to handle one, if I did.

I want to get better. I do. But when I break down, I can't think straight. I become delusional, I hallucinate, &amp; my impulse control goes out the window. I know that I need help, but I can't get it, and I'm extremely scared.

I don't think how bad I'm really doing even hit me until this weekend. I attempted, and was in the process of recovering (in a do-it-yourself way, via staying in bed &amp; ditching assignments that I wasn't in the right state of mind to be completing anyway) when I broke down again. I'm alright now, but the odds feel ridiculous, and I have no idea what's going to happen next.

I tried telling one of my friends, who lives just four floors down, but I could never go into detail about things. I just said that I'm doing badly, without elaborating much... I wanted to go into further detail, but now I feel like it isn't worth it, that I'd be bothering her or making her upset when she doesn't need to be. She always gets this look, like she's about to cry, and all I want to do is stop talking. I don't want to hurt her with any of this; I know it's already out of my hands, but I feel like that's one thing that I can still hang onto. I know that if I die then it wouldn't have mattered, but I keep thinking that maybe I can magically pull out of this. I don't think I can anymore.

I'm tired. After all the times that I've tried to end my life - sometimes for absolutely no reason at all - I shouldn't even be here anymore. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

201740,"HelloHello everyone. I don't frequent this subreddit, so I'll start this post off with an introduction. I'm Ambasea, a young writer whose current project is The Language of Stories, an interactive story hosted in a Discord server. The story is divided into three parts, or ""chapters"", and the first two have been completed, but I'm really considering cancelling the third.

I absolutely despise my story. Don't get me wrong, I love working on it. I love writing it. I love drawing the illustrations and characters. But because I'm the one who's creating it, I cannot bring myself to see anything about it as even remotely half-decent.

As I said earlier, it's an interactive story, so the audience interacts with the characters. At the beginning, there were about ten participants, and that made me really happy, as this is my first project that I've released into the world and not just kept to myself. I've been getting to know my audience members really well, and we've all become friends. But now, there are only four people who are participating/reading up on what happens. No matter what anyone says, I can't believe that anyone actually enjoys it. The people who are participating are just doing it because I'm their friend. I hate myself, and I hate my work, too. I don't see any reason to keep at it anymore because I haven't improved in the eight years I've made up stories. 

Not only have I failed to create anything meaningful, but I've also failed to create anything even half-decent. I know that creates always hate their work. But I feel guilty even calling myself a ""creator"" or an ""author"" because just attaching that label to myself and putting myself in those groups is a huge insult to everyone who's actually created something good. 

I hate this world, and I hate myself most of all. I’d say I’m on the verge of suicide, but I’d never kill myself because I’m religious. 

But you know what? Maybe it's not my fault. Maybe it's the audience's fault. ...Is it? Is it mine? I don't know anymore.",suicide

I started going to therapy last year, but my insurance really doesn't cover much and I only have one option for a therapist. In all honesty, it just feels like she's waiting for the hour to end and doesn't seem to have any compassion. She comes across as very cold and I'm not really comfortable sharing anything personal with her, which is kind of a problem for a therapist. At this point, I just keep going so they don't cut off my meds.

I wasn't too worried about it until recently. I used to just have fleeting thoughts about it, but over the past few months I've caught myself actually thinking pretty in depth about how I would do it.

Has anybody found any solutions to finding somebody to talk to?

Everyone seems to have different answers to this question, but none seem right too me. 

I'm 18 years old and have had depression for the past two years or so. I am overweight and originally believed that to be the reason for my depression. I started going to the gym and eating more healthier as a way to combat this, and have actually made amazing progress so far. I'm still unhappy though, so that clearly wasn't my issue. I can't believe I'm so naive that I thought that was the only thing wrong. 

I am currently in my second year of college in the UK (pretty much dropped out at this point, haven't attended for a while now) and as the days go on, I'm discovering how useless the thing we call life is. I've failed my education, I'm struggling to find a job, and I have no money to my name whatsoever. All around me I see successful people, and I fucking hate it so much. I have so much envy for others. I wish I could be those people but it's just not a possible thing for me anymore, I tried. 

I've given up caring these days and nobody I speak to seems to understand that. I wouldn't mind dropping off the planet right now and being at peace finally, but I still feel as though there is hope for me, I just need to find out what life means to me. That's the issue at hand. 

Maybe my time may come soon. Maybe later on in life. I just wish something would take me away now, so I don't have to deal with my thoughts and feelings...

It was quite an emotional roller-coaster as she kept talking about suicides, but I started to not take it very seriously, because she kept threatening it over and over, and each time it did not happen, until it became dull, however, just 2 days ago, I think she really did it, she gave me one last message ""you were very kind {name} &lt;3"" and from then on I have not seen her reply to any of my messages since, and has been completely inactive. She did told me her previous attempt was pills, but she survived, I have a bad feeling about this time. Yesterday I cried for hours on end, it's this loneliness, empty, hopeless feeling, that she no longer exists in the current world, complete dread and despair, she seemed so unique that I feel like I will never meet another person like this ever again.

I know without a shadow of doubt in my mind that I'm going to kill myself eventually as I feel like I have to, the only consistent feeling or concept through my entire life is that I shouldn't be alive and how much I hate myself. indont really feel much of anything emotionally anymore. I'm not really sure what to do anymore. I didn't expect to live to 25 and I'm struggling with continuing. Which brings up the subject of what I'm dealing with now I guess. Sorry in advance for all this as I'm writing without edits. 
The only thing that makes me feel anything positive now is weed or opes. I don't drink but I love pain killers more than anything on earth. The gut wrenching aches and constant emotional pain are just replaced with a thick and euphoric buoyant haze of nihilism. I don't have to feel good or bad, it's fine, I can chill in bed and watch judge Judy re runs and eat the same 2 bagels for a few days straight.  I have severe anxiety that's developing into an agoraphobic fear of leaving my room to go outside. Thing is people hate me. I hope someone can emphasize with this. I'm queer and try to maintain an androgynous appearance. I get screamed at from people in cars when they drive past.  I get called a faggot at my job. Even into my 20s. Yes it really happens. Sorry I can't prove it. Many people who aren't queer are constantly rude to my face for the way I look. I know this is something lots of people worse off  than myself deal with 100x worse. I have too much anxiety to make friends locally and do social things. I just work and get high.  Most people's advice boils down to modifying myself to make life easier and more comfortable for the people who would go out of their way to fuck with me.  I suppose I can understand the perspective and I've recognized it since I was extremely young. it's that I am disposable, unwanted and ultimately the legitimacy of my entire personhood is something people want to ignore or struggle with. So I should die. I want to die and I'm well aware most of the culture I live in would be relieved with that as well.  Im tired. I'm all out of money, drugs, and god dammit I am hungry, starving at the moment. Might do my little bread run tonight if I can out of bed.

everytime it’s just me and her in the room she would run up here and start twerking trying to get my attention, the only way I get her to go away is if I scream at her really loud or try to push her away. she never does this in front of our parents and acts all innocent when they’re around. she will also speak in a tone that’s considered ’slutty’ basically what I’m trying to say, is she will try to get my attention by doing sexual things. I’ve had incidents where I’ve been on the couch and she‘d sneak up behind the couch and jump on my crouch and try to get her ass near my face.

201815,"Just need a place to vent.23 years old, things changed after my concussion in 2015. That's when the depression and suicidal idealation set in. My past 3 relationships have been plagued with myriads of instability, it really has begun to feel like I'm the problem. I wish my brain was wired differently,  I've isolated myself the last few years, it's hard leaving the comfort of being alone sometimes. I'm always riddled with guilt on making my parents life harder. They fled a war torn country to work 7 days a week 14 hours a day for decades to give me and my brother a better life than they had. I'm so sorry guys. I'm so sorry I'm an emotional and financial burden I know I wasn't the child you envisioned having. I feel foolish, praying to a god that I may  not believe in to give me some form of a terminal disease so I can finally die. I'm a waste of this planet's resources and my families. I just want to get into medical school first. I know it's the one thing I can leave for my parents when I'm gone. Something to finally be proud of their son for. I've begun recording voice notes as of tonight, messages I can leave them. To tell them how sorry I am for being who I am. I'm sorry for being the black sheep of our family I'm  so sorry for the stress I've caused you guys. The needle is still under my dresser. With enough potassium.chloride to instantly induce a heart attack. Maybe one day I'll have the balls to actually push the plunger after pricking my vein. You both always deserved better.

Eventually, I feel more drained than I was before, and I end up not doing telling anything at all.

My problem in life is that no one wants to be in a relationship with me or maybe it's just that life's changing I really don't know exactly.

I'm a realtivly good looking guy even though I genuinely hate but everyone tells me I'm cute and hot I jus front see what they see.

The first girl that I was trynna get with in grade 12. I loved her with all of my heart. We planned on traveling the world together, doing graffiti, open a pot farm, etc... I personally was against having kids myself but her she said she loved me so much that we planned on it one day. Im not gonna go even slightly in depth with this but I have a whole 8000+ word note in my phone of everything she said to me that made me feel special. Found out she said everything I just said to 4 other guys and fucked 8 guys for free weed and drugs and yes she admitted to it. I was heart broken since she was the closest I've been to being in a relationship. I moved on quickly.

My best friend:

Me and my bestfriend max have been bestfriends before kindergarten so 15 years now. We became friends with benefits in grade 7 and fucked around constantly like sending nudes giving me blow jobs and handjobs all these years. We used to sext 2 or 3 times a week since grade 9 - 12
We were so horny for each other imagine quagmire if she had a quagmire girlfriend but they are exclusive to each other. That's us

She was unpopular and bullied crazy and so was I in middle school. We just graduated and she left highschool incredibly popular and I left highschool with her and 2 others being my ONLY friends. 

She hits guys hitting her up and I don't have girls hitting me up, she goes to party's, I dont, shes rich, I'm not.

I genuinely have loved her since elementary school and she used too also
 Anyways my point: 
We rarely sext or mess around anymore. It went from 3 times a week to I'm lucky if we mess around once a month and it kinda hurts alot. Knowing the if another guy took my place and it really hurts me since ringer no action.

She knows I like her since I told her and I flirt and she's happy that I told her and we are celebrating Valentine's this year and she said she's looking forward to it more then anything and she genuinely seems super excited. But I asked her out and she said she isn't looking for a relationship but one day she would love to be with me. She tells me all the time that I'm the most amazing sweetest person she even knew etc.... I'm too drunk to write it all out since eits a. Lot. But basically I'm her most favorite and valued friend and I'm unlike any guys she's ever met and every girl need a guy like me. She tells me this all he time. She NEEDS to hangout with me EVERY.SINGLE.DAY even if it's for 5 minutes she needs to see me.

201854,"Need help and don't know where else to turn. Long post ahead.I find myself constantly digging myself into a hole that continues to get deeper and deeper no matter what I do.
For some background, I had a bright future ahead of me, I was top of my class through middle and high school, I was ranked one of the best in my sport in my country. Yet through all this I've always been depressed, I never really had many friends through it all, I have an emotionally abusive family.


Last year, I was admitted to one of the best Universities in the United States on a full scholarship, and managed to flunk out my first semester and dropping out during my second. It's not that classes were hard, in fact I had all A's 3/4th into the semester, it just felt like I didn't deserve anything I had in life and had constant suicidal thoughts. Now this school semester, I've been constantly lying to everyone, and I know it will come back to me and I will be disowned most likely by my family and not know what to do. I have been pretending to be going to school at home, and it's not that I didn't want to go to school, it’s just all the papers had gotten lost, and I didn’t have the guts to tell my parents right away that the school had dropped me because they didn’t have the required information, and by the time I could’ve done anything I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it for this semester. 


Just 3 days ago I was ready to do it, I was ready to end it all and I was going to, I was going to end it all. This wouldn’t have been my first time, as I have tried before, but every other time I would cry and not want to go through with it, but I still tried. Now I no longer cry, I have come to peace with the idea that I must die. I’m never going to accomplish anything I know if I stay all I will be is a burden and a disgrace for my family along with not being able to live with myself knowing that I had a good future ahead of me, and now no matter what I do I don’t feel like I will be good enough. It honestly feels like this has become my only option. I’m only coming here because this is my final attempt to seek help, I don’t know what I want from this, but I feel like I have to have some input before I go.

I'm fat and I don't deserve to live. I guess I'm kind of at peace for now. Everything is set up. I have a plan that's probably too detailed for my shit. I'm selfish to think this way, I know. People have it worse than I do and they care too much for me. They should give all their attention to my younger sister. She's kind of spoiled, but she's really smart and talented. I wasted my time when I was younger and didn't work hard enough. I ran away from home when I was nine, heading for the railroad tracks, not to run away after my mom and dad dragged me down the stairs and tried to hit me with a hobby horse. I was barefoot and was dragged home by the police. From then on, I started to be depressed. On some days, I would withdraw from my family and friends. My mom and I fought more often. She cared about high math grouping. High grades. She made sure I didn't read too much fiction. She pushed piles of non fiction books at me. She told me I wasn't smart. She denied she ever said anything when I confronted her. I started to cut when I turned eleven. Just scratches, no blood. Then I found glass and a scalpel. I cut deeply until my mom found out. She gave me the silent treatment for a day. Then I found myself halfway up railing on the Kennedy center roof in DC on a school trip. I regret not jumping. I cut more. I cried over a bottle of pills. I wrote over five separate note hidden in my room. I made a plan to jump off the golden gate bridge. I saw 3 therapists. And here I am now. I'm done with this life. A little over a month left. I've told myself to stay strong, keep the mask I've been keeping for four years from crumbling. I've given up all hope. ",suicide
201857,"Out Of Options If you look through my previous posts, as I'm sure some of you will, you will see my current issues. I live with my in laws, my husband never stands up for me against them, and I have two kids with him. It goes much deeper now and it isn't as black and white as ""just leave him"", ""just go to a shelter"".

  First, my MIL and I got into a fight. She attacked first but NOBODY believes me. She has nerve damage in one hand but is fully capable of picking up my 50lb toddler and driving...but nobody believes she attacked me because ""she's just an old crippled lady"". She's only 58, by the way.
  
  She threatened to shoot me but once again, her nerve damaged hand served as an excuse as to why she ""couldn't if she wanted to"". Now it isn't like I am a pathological liar. I have caught my husband and in laws in more lies than they have ever caught me in, yet they only believe what fits their agenda.

  They ALL want me to leave my kids with my MIL and just leave. They have been trying very hard to just kick me out. The only thing keeping me here is that I promised to go to a psychiatrist because they have all agreed that I'm a violent psycho demon who needs serious help. They do not believe whatsoever that my MIL was at fault despite her admitting to threatening to shoot me, then grabbing my child from me to use as a shield.

  So the police were called, they took everyone's side but mine of course, CPS then came out and charged me with child neglect for trying to get my baby out of my psycho MIL's arms. I am now required to go seek mental help. I take Paxil for depression and anxiety by the way, so it was reallll easy for my husband and his family to throw the ""she's psycho"" card out there.

 Now even if I do leave, I cannot take my children with me and I can't divorce my husband without losing my children. My husband has humiliated me regularly in front of everyone, encourages the ""she's crazy"" talk, tells me that I'm not worth love and I deserve everything I get, and tries to make his mother look like a saint. He does not believe that I've tried my best to get along with my MIL and nobody was in the room when my MIL attacked me to be a witness. 

 I can't describe how badly this hurts. I can't even describe it. I love my children more than anything at all and they know that, which is why they are constantly trying to use my kids against me and threaten to take them away from me and grab them from me. I watched both of my children fight for their lives in the NICU while my husband wasn't even there. Everyone knows this and how much I love them. My husband and in laws want me dead or homeless - either one suits them.
  So I'm out of options here. There's only one way out. A psychiatrist could help me to an extent, but since it's my MIL that attacked me, she's likely to do it again and everyone easily believes it's my fault despite evidence saying otherwise. I'm just out of options and I had to get this out there somewhere. I love my kids more than anything and that is the only reason I hesitate to end everything...but I'm really running out of time and the ability to keep them since everyone wants to take them from me.",suicide

201871,"Live in fear or stagnate. How is there any other way?I've spent so much of my life working hard to get ahead. I put so much effort into my field of work to the point it took over my life. I tried to enjoy it along the way but i always would isolate.

When I was young my father would beat me quite a bit with a belt. Sometimes he would leave me to ""stand in the corner"" facing it for hours until dinner. Or he would as a punishment give me the cold shoulder for months. As time went on I would isolate more and more on my computer out of fear of my father but also general anxiety around people. We moved around a lot as a family. One of the houses I lived in I had a small one bedroom upstairs and everyone else was downstairs and I liked it because I could be alone and away from him. 

I have lost so much time and energy towards life throughout the years. There was so much work done and squandered and nothing really gained. There is not much to be happy for anymore to me. I have no friends, no life, I live with my mom and a couple manipulative and abusive people. 

I have been fired from jobs, worked hard on faith for years for lower pay to see things never reach fruition. There has been so much energy I have put in on faith and trust that it will eventually pay off and now at 28 I feel it really hasnt at all. There is nothing in this world that makes me happy anymore. Even alcohol which I've had some great and bad times with in the past doesn't do it for me. My depression if that is even what this is has been with me as long as I can remember and nothing ever changes. The more effort I put into things the more I am dissapointed it doesn't work out. 

Im wondering what is the point. It seems nothing is really gained from trying but stagnation and waiting to die isn't really worth it either. Whats going to change things around if everything is meaningless? I've felt alone for most of my life even when around people and know I am not very up there on the looks. As a man I have been invisible for just about forever and nothing seems to be going to change any time soon. Im done trying to make up for lost time or put my best foot forward.

I feel like killing myself would be a solution but it's not, that'll just be dying a bitter death, I'll just take my shit with me to the grave. Telling people won't help, hurting myself won't help, unleashing it on others will certainly not help, I'm at a lost right now. I want to cry but I don't like crying everytime and I feel like it won't help at this point. I feel this knot in my throat, something heavy pressing against my chest and I don't know how to get rid of it and I wanna do it on my own, I have always needed help with everything, I wasn't able to do something on my own without fucking up and I don't wanna bother people with my shitty teenager problems cuz what's the point on working on something of it's gonna go away at some point, because it *will* go away at some point I guess, I hope. I feel like I'm close to filling up the glass and when it overflows somebody will probably get hurt and I don't wanna do that but I don't know how to avoid it either.

I also feel like it's wrong for me to feel like this, like I don't have a reason to be sad and should just stop bitching about every little thing, and that just makes it worse. I feel more like nothing important rather than less sad. I feel like I'm simply pathetic in everything, school, personal life, social life. There's just a lot of secrets I always kept to myself and I feel like telling them would make everyone laugh and move away from me and I hate the thought of being alone, I already feel alone and knowing this would make that feeling a reality is painful.

Not at all, things have only gotten progressively worse for me. I tried branching out and making new friends, everyone wants nothing to do with me. A girl who I thought was nice to me really was just kidding and thought my misery was hilarious. My parents just tell me to 'get over it' and stop being depressed but I can't. I can't ignore the reality of being alone and miserable for the long existence I have ahead of me. I just guess happiness isn't intended for everyone and I'm stuck watching others be happy. Every time I see someone become in a relationship on facebook or I see a couple holding hands on the sidewalk, I always recognize that as something I will never be able to have and that life is just a cruel fucking joke where everyone is happy and content with their lives except myself and others who get to watch and never know what happiness is like. Bottom line is that I have found happiness is impossible for me and that I can never have it even for a second. I don't want to live a life full of misery and torment, where I can only watch as others enjoy their lives while I will be eternally sad. My 17 years has allowed me to see what life will truly be like for me in the future and it doesn't look good, I wish I could live like everyone else but that has become apparently impossible. I will always be miserable and alone and nothing except death can change that. It's a big and permanent decision but I think it will be the best for not only me but everyone else. No one will give a shit that I'm gone, people at school will probably laugh when they hear I'm dead.

I have severe body dystopia, my mom also pretends to support me being transgender but she turns around and starts picking on me for it. She picks on me because of my mental health, making fun of my sleeping patterns because of it then screaming at me about the fact I can't sleep. 

I don't have a lot of true friends that actually give a crap about my mental health, I'm teased a lot at school and my band program because I'm mental unwell. The friends I hang out with accept my personality, but they never want to hear about my poor ass mental health. I tried killing myself over he summer, but no one seemed to listen nor care.

The only person I care about in this world is gone, which my mom picks on my father also. I've been molested by my old step father (technically my bio father, but he's SUCH a piece of shit that he doesn't deserve the title of a father.) my mom never made a police report until 8 months after coming home with bruises on my body from a beating that my old stepfather gave me. 

I want to end my life on the spot, nothing in life is enjoyable. I've stopped most of my hobbies thanks to my poor mental health. My hobbies and escapes from the position I'm in amount nothing to my past. I'm a worthless piece to society, I've been wanting to end my life for the last 4 years.

Why can't they be there to ask if i am okay or if i'm doing well and just ask me, like how I ask them? I always reach out to them whenever they feel sad but how come no one is there to do the same for me? Do I have to explicitly tell themselves that I am suicidal in order for them to help me?

I go to a Dr, I take the medicine I need, I practice self-care, I do my best to cultivate a balanced life, I know all the tricks to keep this from happening...and it still happens.

201913,"Drunken Rant, Suicide Note Prototype, Pity Parade, What The Fuck EverHello everyone. 

I think about death and suicide every day. I drink a lot and the only time I'm not suicidal at all is when I'm stoned, which is what I'm about to go do after I post this.

I go through life in a daze. I'm always outside everything that's happening to me in one way or another. It's just going through the motions day in and day out. The job I have I mainly have to be able to buy booze and weed.

I don't have any active plans to kill myself, except maybe through cirrhosis or alcohol poisoning, but by and large I really don't think my life is worth living. I don't think I deserve to be really happy, I don't think I deserve to be loved, I don't think I deserve a fulfilling life because I don't care enough. 

I don't want to make an effort to try to get all of these things that everyone in my family has: a master's degree, a well-paying job in my field, a nice house, a spouse and kids. It all seems just too fucking hard. A lot of things in my life that I'm supposed to want and supposed to do and think and feel...they just don't come naturally to me and it all just seems so fucking hard. 

I hate myself. I really do. I want to destroy myself from the inside and half the time that's what my brain tells my body to do is destroy itself. 

I honestly don't know how much longer I'm going to last the way I'm going, but there is no other way. Every other path I could take, every other choice I could make, it's not worth it. 

There's nothing ahead of me but fear and darkness and I want it to end one way or another. 

If it weren't such a hassle I probably would have already bought a gun and done myself in, because I can't bring myself to overdose on pills or cut my wrists or hang myself because they'd take too long and might not even work.

I think about my mom and dad and little brother and the rest of my family hearing I killed myself and telling each other and crying or screaming or I don't know what and it hurts, yes, but I can't keep lying to them all. I can't keep bullshitting them about how great my life is. 

I think half the reason I don't try very hard to stay connected to people is because I know I'm going to leave them sooner or later.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you've made it this far. Reply to me or don't, I don't give a fuck. It does feel better to write this down and get some of the shit inside me out, even though it felt like pulling teeth the whole time.

201935,"More than 2 months in at college, there is NOT one single day without having suicidal thoughtsOf course some days are less depressing than others. Some days start depressing then end hopeful. Some days are vice-versa. 


- I miss my old friends and they are slowly slipping away from my life.


- I am still having trouble connecting on a deeper level with my college friends and still come off as socially-awkward &amp; anxious. 


- I am struggling with my grades and just getting by.


- My passion is dying.


- I feel like I've become a burden and a bother to everyone around me.


- I'm tired of being in the closet and have decided to be agnostic/atheist while going back-and-forth with religion thanks to the fear of ""going to hell"" &amp; the conservative Christian environment around me even among my college classmates. I was supposed to come out to the only group of friends I feel 100% safe with, but it didn't happen because we're all too busy and far away from each other. 


- The suicide notes are halfway ready, but I fear I won't actually go through with it. Because even though I'm unstable enough to want to give up, I'm stable enough to still be afraid of dying or going to hell or making my friends/family sad.",suicide

201937,"Counseling Red FlagsHey all. So I want some advice on what criteria have to be met before counselors have you involuntarily hospitalized. I’ve been seeing a counselor at my campus for a while now, and I’ve talked to her about my suicidal thoughts. She assured me I’d basically have to tell her I have active plans before she’d have me committed, but I know it may not be that rigid if she has genuine fears for my safety. Explaining my situation is probable easiest here. 

I’ve had a pretty bad bout of suicidal thoughts lately, and I think I know of an event that probably triggered it. I recently came into a bunch of hydrocodone from having multiple surgeries in a short span, and not using all of the pain meds. I won’t lie, having something so readily available does kinda intensify the thoughts. I want to be honest with my counselor about these things, but not at the cost of my freedom and lifestyle. Should I tell her or not? 

I’m sure a lot of you nice people are going to say I should tell her everything, but I have too much going on to be hospitalized right now. It’d really fuck my life up, so I’m avoiding it for now. Would these admissions be probable cause for her to have me committed? ",suicide

2. Thou shalt not ask for any time of actions or rewards to be given to your post

4. Remember the self post weekend, to keep it image free

Fake it till you make it actually worked in a weird way because by acting like I didn't care about anything I started to not care. Then a couple months ago I started a new job. Things were ok, coworkers were fun to be with, but I never really hung out with any of them outside of work. So I got the brilliant idea of going bowling! Surprisingly a bunch of them seemed as excited as I was to hangout together outside of work. Last week we decided that tonight would work for everyone and that we should get together at my place before hand to pregame. Awesome! So yesterday I go out and spend 100$ on alcohol/snacks for everyone . Today I found out that half the people couldn't make it, and the others were going to a different coworkers. So now I'm left here feeling more alone and let down than I have in years. I feel like all of that work I put into trying to be happy alone disappeared in an instant.

I've already had one close call and would like to avoid another.

I think I might finally be ready to try to get some help for my depression but I've a few questions/concerns first. 

1) How would I even go about trying to get myself checked into a hospital? I don't want to wait for a doctor's appointment but I also think it would be incredibly awkward for a perfectly (physically) healthy person to just walk into an ER and try to convince them that I need help.

2) If I was admitted to the hospital, is it possible to keep it completely secret from everybody (family, employers etc.)? I am 24 and still live with my parents but I don't want them or anybody else in my family to know about my depression. I am staying at somebody else's house for the next week so I was thinking maybe this would be  a good chance for me to go to the hospital without anybody noticing, assuming I'm not in there for any more than a few days.

3) What would/could it cost, if anything (I live in Canada by the way)? I've got no money right now so I wouldn't be able to pay any charges.

Sorry if these are dumb questions. I haven't even seen a doctor since I was a little kid so I'm completely clueless about how any of this works. Any information or advice anybody can give me would be greatly appreciated.

my psychiatrist is the only one in the area seeing new patients, and he will not talk to me about the abuse. he thinks all of my misery is my dad dying, and half of each session is how dad overcome his illness, so i can too. whee.

my husband lost his job and got another at the same time i did. our whole lives changed.

my second to last semester of grad school starts next week. i drive three hours total for work. i have about three hours to do anything after work. i feel overwhelmed and unable to focus. so i started taking adderall.

my hands and feet always hurt. literally. my backs out of alignment or something weird. iono. but they burn from the inside out. i take 1800 mg of gabapentin and 100 mg of tramadol a day just to manage it. it's still there, just much less. without it, i could not work or go to school. it used to be so bad i couldn't even hold a book open. i also get migraines. a lot of them. weekly. i have no diagnosis. we're ""treating the symptoms,"" but that means no cure. not now.

there's clonazepam, effexor, risperidone. im still depressed, anxious, and hallucinating, though. all fairly high doses. they dont work.

i have nightmares where my mom kills herself repeatedly, right after telling me its my fault. i have nightmares my dad sells me into sex slavery and laughs at the rape. i have nightmares like that every night, multiples. i wake up already miserable because its so crystal clear.

i don't want to spend the rest of my life in pain and grief. i hurt so much. and i don't know how to deal. i stopped eating, but i havent stopped the treadmill. clears my head for just a little bit.

They've been nothing but supportive. But I feel so exposed, I'm analyzing everything I say or that they say, I feel like I've overshared, which makes me feel anxious and suffocated at the same time.

201996,"I'm planning on jumping in front of a trainFirst I just want to illustrate just how hopeless my life is. I'm 20, I've seriously been thinking of suicide for the past year. I have bad depression, borderline personality disorder and extreme anxiety. I've been to about 8 treatment programs (I've lost count). I have lost all of my friends due to drug addiction. I have been unable to keep a job because my anxiety gets really bad and I end up never going again. My family doesn't understand anxiety and thinks I'm just being lazy and don't want to do anything. Now it's to the point that I absolutely have to get a job again, because I owe my dad a lot of money due to an expensive speeding ticket and they are tired of me sitting around doing nothing and while they don't say it directly they want me to save up money and move out. It's extremely overwhelming because I know myself and I know getting and keeping a job is probably an impossible task for me. I'm the definition of stuck.

I've had plenty of therapists and none of them have worked, its usually me just venting for most of the time and them not saying much. I'm currently on 1800mg of gabapentin, 600mg of trileptal, and 225mg of effexor a day, I've been on countless more (prozac, zoloft, lexipro, etc.) and none of them have been able to dull down my anxiety or depression where I can actually continue with life. I just recently saw my psychiatrist and he said that there's nothing more to do for my anxiety and that the rest I have to work and actually face it. The problem is, I know I can't do that, and I end up coming across as just a lazy bum to my doctor as well.

Every since I lost all of my friends 3 years ago, I  haven't made any since and I've completely lost hope that anyone would want to be around an ugly, fat, disgusting, weird, distorted fuck like myself. There have been people in my recent IOP program that have told me I'm a very nice person and intelligent and insightful, but that isn't what matters in the eyes of modern human society. If I can't get a job and hold my own, I'm worthless, just a burden, and a waste of space.

I've had no hope that I can possibly go on with life for a while, but there's this nonsensical will to live inside me, because deep down I don't want to die, I just don't want to live. I seriously cannot take the everyday anxiety from doing barely anything, knowing that I have to do things everyday that will just bring my anxiety even higher. And the things I want in life like meeting a girl and starting a family will never happen if I can't get a job, be mentally stable, or be a solid foundation. That's just not me. For me, the great things in life are just an illusion because with my mental ailments, they are impossible to grasp.

My family loves me, especially my mom, and I know how much it would crush them if I died, but living a human life is an impossible feat for me, and looking forward all I see is misery, uncofortability, and sadness.

It's worth noting that the one thing that has worked for my anxiety and depression and everything under the sun is marijuana. But my family has made it clear I'm kicked out if  I use again, and then I'll be broke and homeless and end up killing myself that way too, so while it's great that there's something out there that helps me, it's not an option.

Another thing worth noting is, while it might not even be true, I saw someone on reddit say they had 4 friends who took LSD and ended up killing themselves. They were all on zoloft at the time. I have taken LSD twice on zoloft. So part of me thinks offing myself is my destiny and I've just been putting it off for a year and I just need to fucking do it because I'm stuck and the only way out is to check out.

So to sum up, I have life crippling anxiety that prevents me from maintaining adult responsibilities, I have no hope that there is a good future for someone like myself, I'll just end up living an even more pathetic existence than I am already, in a constant state of anxiety and mental agony, nothing I've tried has worked, I clearly wasn't meant to live a human life, and getting hit by a train seems painless, immediate and will most likely get the job done, and my energy will hopefully go somewhere else where my soul can actually find purpose and hope.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",suicide

M + G: My Two Girl Friends, also the only two people i will willingly talk to about my mind and my thoughts.

G, R, K or D: My guy(one girl) Friends, help me stop thinking, not honest about my feelings with though.

Moods: 
1. Normal Me: Rarely shows, best version of me
2. Depressed Me: Just feel really down and sad. Usually leads to self harm, shaking and trembling and a inability to sleep.
3. Euphoric Rush Me: Sudden and random spurts of happiness, leads to uncontrollable eye movement and a need to move. Also leads to a inability to sleep.
4. Murderous Me: Worst version of me, physically cant stop, mentally cant stop. I am obsessed with homicide. This as well leads to a inability to sleep, but easily the worst.
5. Mix: Mix of two of them (usually 2 and 4) which just leads to absolute chaos.

Yesterday: Felt good. But the day consisted of many, many mood swings. It didn't lead to anything bad. So it was a win. 

Today: It kinda feels like yesterday. I woke up kinda depressed and I wasn't ready to take on the world yet. I sent M and G goodnight texts last night and only G responded. I sent them both goodnight texts again tonight. And once again only G responded. Kinda hurts, not gonna lie, I've layed every thought I've had on the table for those two. It feels better when both of them care. Online school was a bore, had little work and it went well. But it just leads to thoughts, and I hate thoughts. Bright spot of the day:  Feels like the reddit community has started to accept me. So that feels good. Oh, and I quit my job today. Fuck that place, and fuck people. The 10 months were good while it lasted. But after the busy days and crazy people..... I've had enough. So im done. Im not returning. Im kinda hurting tonight. Im sad and tired.

202004,"This might be a long one. I feel very low.There's a fair bit to this story so I want to apologise in advance if anyone decides to read this. 

I suffer from schizophrenia and depression, both of which are medicated. Despite my medication I feel that I don't have much relief from either of these conditions. It seems to be I'm untreatable as I have been given so many different combinations of drugs and none have ever worked. I have a history with drugs and recently have fallen back to smoking cannabis in an attempt to self-medicate. Let me just say I know this was fucking stupid and I really do feel guilty for this.

Last week I got an intense period where I heard voices (Which has happened in the past, however before being put on anti-psychotic medication) which led me to harm myself with a razorblade to the point that I needed stitches. I'm sitting here having torn these stitches out and I really don't know why. I can't go back to be restitched, the way they look at someone with self inflicted injuries will just make me feel worse. 

Even when I'm lucid I still have the strongest urge to kill myself. I have attempted to OD on my medication before but to no avail. It feels like my life is ebbing away until I am finally able to stop it and it really scares me. I can't even talk with my best friend about this because I don't want to burden her and she's working til 1am. I literally have no one here and I don't know what to do.

This is the face of giving up. 

I'm almost 40. I'm a woman. I've been fat, I've been skinny, I've been fit, I'm fat again because skinny and fit didn't work so what's the point. I'm smart. I've been told by others that I'm fun. I'm into interesting stuff, mostly cars and stuff. I'm a veteran. I'm still single, lonely, and I'm giving up. 

I've been dealing with depression (again) for two years now. Medication doesn't help. Doctors dont' seem to give a shit. I moved back home thinking that would help. It didn't. 

I feel unwanted. Ugly. Unable to be loved and easily forgotten about. I do not know what it's like to be loved by anyone not related to me. I'm sorry but that's too long in life to go on feeling this way. 

My biggest fear if that suicide wouldn't work and then I'd end up messed up worse than nature has made me and unable to finally end it. If my car blew up with me in it, I wouldn't care. I've tried slicing my wrists and chickened out. I've thought about just steering my car into a wall but I'm sure I'd somehow survive that. I'm sure swallowing pills would just make me puke and then pass out. I'm utterly convinced that even an attempt at suicide would equate to as much a failure as the rest of my life has been. 

No one loves me who isn't blood related to me. I've been married before but haven't even been proposed to. I have no kids. I can't have kids now courtesy of bad genes and no reproductive organs that work as they should. To top it off, now I'm missing half of them courtesy of endometriosis. I'm miserable. It won't stop. I've been this way for almost 30 years. What's the point. 

I'm saying this here because I just want these feelings to end. I can't handle this anymore. I used to be full of hope. Now I'm just full of dread. Tonight will be a night full of alcohol and whatever I can find. I'm sure ,though, I'll still be around tomorrow. ",suicide

Thank you for all the comments, I haven’t felt this much warmth in awhile and never knew I could get them from strangers online.

I’m sure it’s somewhere in between. Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement it is very humbling.

Here are parts of my note that I’m embarrassed now partly incoherent and partly narcissistic but I hope will shed some light for whoever:

—
It didn’t work. All the factors in my life added up to not work with my particular situation, genetics, epigenetics, pride, neuroticism, lack of consistent social skills, inability to trust, laziness in right action, busy work, lack of emotional health, indulgence, lack of stability through relationships, family, and friends, delusional ambitious visions without the prerequisite steps, narcissism. All of this has contributed to my failure ...

...I can’t say I’m not mad. But I get it. It happened. I lost and some people won...on the other hand you had these thinking big schemes and fucked it up. Now you continuously went for broke without even the bare resources in managing life and now you don’t get to experience life any more. Oh well...

202033,"I utterly fucking despise my existenceI’m not doing shit anymore, I’m not attending classes, I’m not calling back my friends or my parents. I’m a lonely piece of shit that consumes and gives nothing. All day I sleep or play games, or sometimes on the shit days I just sit and stare at the ceiling. I fucking hate it, I’m not doing anything fun or productive. I never do any of my hobbies or anything anymore, it’s just pain and distraction of that pain the whole day trough. I used to have a great passion for music, I have barely listened to music, let alone touched an instrument.
And I feel so fucking lonely, I stay in my room the whole day with the door locked, it gives me a sense of comfort, as if the outside world doesn’t exist. I see people for like 2 hours a day and that’s probably it. I fucking hate it I fucking hate it. 

And I can’t look in the mirror anymore either, every time I do I see someone that I fucking hate, personality and appearance wise. I’m afraid of showering and shaving, because every time I look down I see a body that doesn’t fit. My face is super masculine and I can’t stand it. I don’t eat except one communal meal with my roommates. I think I’m becoming severely underweight and I don’t give a fuck. I don’t wash my clothes and I don’t clean anything, including myself. My room is a shithole, my desk is full of empty beer cans and bottles. 

My thoughts are either occupied by dumb shit or depressing things. All my life I have felt shit and depressed but now I’m living alone and it’s all worse. I miss the safe comfort of childhood, even though I have always been depressed. I miss knowing that your parents were there for everything. I don’t want to do things anymore, I don’t want the responsibilities, I just want to die. 

The moments of happiness are overshadowed by large time spans of nothing, no emotion, no thoughts, just pain. I’m so close to doing it, I had an attempt a month ago, but I chickened out I used to cut myself and punch myself a lot, but now I sometimes just beat the everlasting shit out of myself.

But I don’t even care to mention my whole life, I care about tonight.

I know though, that If I miss one more day of said job I will be written up. 

Today I was plastered with anxiety and my wife and I have been having major problems for at least a year, and it’s really hard to ask for help bla a bla well I asked my wife if I could had a hug before I started work, she didn’t know I asked until it was to late and it turned into this really big fucking deal and all about the shittythings I do and if only if only I didn’t do this this and this then maybe just maybe I would be better off. 

Stupid ass reason to fight but here we are.
She told me she wanted to just give me a hug and make everything ok and went on and on and on about all but’s and reasons why she can’t just give me a hug and make it all ok- she always has to talk shit to me and so much shit I can’t even take in as many words as she spits out. 

Well, I ignore her messages while I’m working and she basically said that because I’m ignoring her because she is unsure if we’re just gonna fight when I get off work that she doesn’t want to stay home tonight and that’s she’s going to take my daughter to a hotel for the night. 

She always takes my daughter , it’s always me being left which further reinforces my loneliness and bullshit. 

I’m off work in less than hour wife quickly packed their bags and left. 
Made sure I told my daughter good night and as I scooped her up when she ran to me , I wished and hoped that she has a beautiful life. A beautiful wonderful life - God.

I can’t continue this way. I feel blindsighted but this night that doesn’t feel like my life because I have been so on the up and up lately but yet it’s so fucking familiar and ... I remember. I have nothing.

I’m in my mid-30s and really struggling. I had a rough early adulthood, filled with drug and alcohol abuse and suicide attempts. My only saving grace was deciding to go back to school in my late 20s, this gave me a lot of purpose. After completing undergrad and then grad school, becoming a masters-level scientist, I was recruited for a job only to be laid off during Covid. I hadn’t even worked a year.

I coped by reminding myself that I hated the job, in fact I hated my whole career. It wasn’t as exciting or gratifying as school had been. Instead I was overworked and miserable. But today I saw a job posting from my company seeking “good” biochemists. This really stung.

As a woman in my mid-30’s with no partner for 4 years, it’s beginning to occur to me I may never have a child or a family. This breaks my heart. 

I have no money and I come from a family with no money. I have no job and I have no desire to continue to gut myself for this unsatisfying career, which was very very underpaid anyway. I have no partner and I can’t expect any family in my future. I will never be a happy or self-sufficient adult, I just won’t. I can’t see any reason why I should keep struggling when everything is indeed a struggle.

Today I want to call it quits. I do not want to wake up tomorrow only to struggle through another day of unsatisfying existence. There is no proof that anything will ever be better.",suicide

202053,"This guilt is going to kill me. Possible TWI am riddled with guilt. Currently in a psych ward after a failed suicide attempt. As soon as I get out I am going to commit suicide, and I won’t fail this time. I guess this is my last attempt at seeking help/reassurance.
Background: I am 23F, suffer with Anorexia, OCD(Pure O), depression and BPD. 
Last year I was in a relationship with my then ex, for about 2 years. It was a pretty toxic/codependent relationship, mostly on my part due to my BPD abandonment issues, insecurity and paranoia.

I have always been very impulsive and reckless in the area of sex(as well as many other areas) never cared about using protection, always let men cum inside me etc without any form of contraception or without knowing their or my STI status. I guess I used(and still do) it as a coping mechanism or form of self harm in a way. 

My ex was always very responsible in this area and preferred to use condoms. However we did end up having a lot of unprotected sex throughout the relationship as I had told them that I wasn’t worried about contraception etc as I’d only ever had unprotected sex in the past and nothing bad had happened. I had convinced myself that I couldn’t get pregnant because of my long history with anorexia and had either no period or very irregular periods for many years. I had also never had an STI but hadn’t been checked in a while. I know this was very irresponsible of me and I feel extremely guilty over it as I could have put my ex’s health at risk. My ex persuaded me to get tested a few months into the relationship and thankfully I was all clear.

However, nearly a year into the relationship I fell pregnant. Again, I feel so terrible because I feel it was my fault that we had unprotected sex, as I was the reckless one and my ex was always very cautious about using protection. I feel like I (unintentionally) misled them that everything would be ok, because I was/am stupid and impulsive and reckless.

Anyway after about a month since finding out I was pregnant I decided to have an abortion. I was having a lot of mixed feelings at the time and went through a period of regret but I put this down to the hormones, because I knew deep down I didn’t want a kid(I have never wanted kids) and realized it was the right decision. 

I was prescribed birth control, which I had always been fearful to take because of my intense fear of weight gain due to my anorexia(I had read that can cause weight gain) and also because I have health OCD and was terrified it would cause me to get a blood clot and have a stroke(I read that BC can increase this risk). However I did start taking it. 

Our relationship kind of started going down hill around this time, I had started a new job as an exotic dancer, which I loved and was beginning to lose interest in the relationship, but I was very much in denial about it at the time. 
I hardly ever wanted to have sex anymore with my then partner which was obvs very upsetting and hurtful to them. And I feel  kind of bad and anxious to say this but I feel like every time we had sex wasn’t entirely consensual, as I was very disinterested but I feel like my partner kept pestering me for it even though I obviously didn’t want to. 

But this is one of the things that has me riddled with guilt and suicidal, after a while I was only sporadically taking my birth control, as well as the fears I described previously, I guess I just didn’t really care about taking it? I didn’t even want to be having sex with my partner, but I didn’t tell them I wasn’t taking it properly. And I guess I was still being my reckless impulsive self, not caring what happened to me etc. My memory is very hazey from around this time, I was going through a lot, had had another suicide attempt around this time and had spent some time in the psych ward. I am now wracking my brain trying to remember exactly what happened and it’s driving me crazy. I can’t remember exactly how often I wasn’t taking the pill. but there was a couple of times that I just went out and bought the morning after pill when I thought there was an increased risk of getting pregnant. For example one night my partner came inside me, I didn’t take my prescribed pill in the morning(just told my partner I forgot) but did go out and buy the morning after pill. I don’t know why I have less anxiety about taking that than the regular pill but anyway. 

So here I am a year later in the psych ward again and here’s why: A few days ago I came across a post on Instagram about “Rape by deceit” which said sex cannot be consensual if you do something such as lying about your STI status or lying that you’re on birth control when you’re not. Well, my world came crashing down around me. I am now convinced that this is what I have done and I cannot live with myself because of it. I feel like a disgusting monster, I don’t see any way out except to kill my self, I have convinced the hospital to discharge me tomorrow so I can do it. I have everything planned",suicide

I can’t recall the last time I was genuinely happy and I don’t think I’ll get the feeling ever again. I tried to commit suicide before and failed. Mostly due to being nervous and being on impulse. I’ve tried the whole “Hold on to life, it’ll get better” thing and it’s been 9 years and I’m almost 25 and guess what? It hasn’t. Still unemployed, still degree-less, basically homeless sleeping at random homes of the junkie acquaintances I’ve made. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’ll never have a loving wife and kids. I’ve come to terms with leaving the small amount of people if any that’ll mourn my death behind. I’m tired of this feeling. Of being alone, of never being loved, of being worthless. Knowing that when I breathe my last breath absolutely no one would give a single fuck. I honestly envy people who don’t have to deal with waking up in the morning, crying, because they’re still alive even though greater people than me have died while I’m here wasting away.  It fucking sucks, id gladly trade my life in a heartbeat for someone more worthy but it doesn’t work that way. It’s selfish of me to take my life that was given to me by my parents but I didn’t ask to be born.  Looking back my only regret is not doing it right the first time to save me from becoming even more empty than I am now. I do however have the perfect playlist, final meal  and spot in which I’ll take my life.  Where I can stare at the beautiful night sky,  floating away while the drugs and alcohol finally take toll on me.

202069,"The struggle is so hardHey reddit.
As you could have guessed I'm depressed and feeling suicidal. I believe I have OCD. The symptoms keep getting worse and worse, especially over the last few years. I am at a point now where even the slightest interruption in my routine sets me off in a spiral of panic attacks and depression.

Knowing these things I have been trying to seek help. I can't afford it myself so I went through the county for aid. It took me three months just to get that done, obsessing over the paperwork to make sure every minute detail was correct. I finally get accepted and I panic to try and make an appointment. That took another few months to become brave enough.

Finally two months ago I recieved a call for an over the phone evaluation. That person submits it to the county psychiatrist office where I wait another month for yet another evaluation where they only confirm what I did on the phone. The social worker who did it says it will take another month or two to see an actual doctor... but by then my county medical will be up and I won't be able to afford to go, the thought of more paperwork and waiting has me in a panic.

I can't enjoy anything anymore, the depression and suicidal thoughts are worsened by my obsessive brain, I have anxiety attacks nearly everyday now and I feel like my mind isn't even my own anymore with all the thoughts that I can't push away.

I don't know what to do... I don't think I can wait for help anymore. I need it now and I can't last much longer.

The only thing keeping me from killing myself right this moment is that I keep making plans in advance so I can tell myself that 'Oh, you can't kill yourself. You need to do that thing!'. The last plan I have set out is a convention in August... after that I don't know if I have the strength to resist any longer.",suicide
202071,"Excessive positivity is absolute bollocks and other criticism of wholesomeness First of all, I was looking for an excuse to say “bollocks” because I think it’s funny. British expressions never fail to make me laugh.

It seems like one can’t go 5 minutes without stumbling a “wholesome” post. It’s really getting irritating. Positivity is cool and all but after a certain point, it gets on my nerves. I bet most people making those kinda of posts are doing it for attention/fake internet points.

I do tend to get SUPER mad about stuff when I’m tired (currently 2:00am) but “wholesomeness” has always annoyed me to some degree. Don’t get me wrong, some of it is genuinely helpful but most people are just trying WAAAYYY too hard. Shit, basically every single “positivity makes life good” speech I’ve ever heard made me want to throw up. Usually it’s people who’ve basically had everything handed to them in life. The people who should be giving these kinds of speeches are those who have been in a bad spot but managed to help themselves, not people who’ve never had any major struggles in life. There was one good positivity speech a while ago at my school but I don’t remember it too well.

I’ve also been noticing a lot of stuff saying “you’re loved, someone cares about you”. Again, this is just (snicker) bollocks a lot of the time. Sure, I bet that many people have someone who cares about them but I feel as if it’s a bit odd to always shove that down their throat. I suppose in some cases this is a good thing to say but a lot of the time it’s just cringe worthy.

202127,"Losing battle with anxiety.I've been fighting a battle to get my severe anxiety symptoms under control.  It started with a visit to the doctor about 2 months ago.  Then I was prescribed pills.  Then I had a suicidal, psychotic break.  Then I was committed to a mental institution for a day.  Then I returned to work the next day and arranged a 2-week leave of absence.  I've been seeing a psychiatrist 2-3 times a week for the past month and I'm trying to resolve my issues through behavioral therapy rather than SSRIs.

I tried my hardest to get back on track with work last week.  The work stress ramped up again and by Friday night I was a wreck.  I spent the entire weekend in a suicidal, angry state.  My job is stressful but it's a field with amazing potential if dedicate myself to it, and I don't want to derail myself from that track.

This morning I woke up have been overwhelmed by dry heaving ever since.  It's my worst physical anxiety symptom, and it's been one of the worst parts of my life for the past 2 years.  I become paralyzed throwing up, but nothing comes out.  I've been going in an out of meetings while dry heaving and trembling in between.  When I go into meetings, enough adrenaline kicks in to keep my body in the zone, so I don't dry heave in those situations.  But it's killing me.  Hiding it is killing me.  Pretending to be strong and fine is killing me.

I think the dry heaving produces endorphins.  I think I'm addicted to those endorphins to get barely enough focus and function to get back on track.

I can't afford to let my coworkers know that I'm continuing to have anxiety problems.  My career is everything to me.  At this point, after already using a leave of absence, I need to tackle the anxiety problems privately going forward to retain the job.

I have no friends and I'm going to be 30 in a few months.  I'm a recovering codependent.  I had some different counseling last year which revealed to me that almost all of my relationships were toxic.  I used to be a stereotypical ""nice guy"" but now I'm a just a confused asshole.  I don't have the required social skills to jibe with how I've had to reinvent myself.

All I can think about is killing myself.  I keep saying it more and more.  The words ""I want to kill myself"" seem to compulsively project from my mouth hundreds of times a day when I'm alone.  I can't get it under control.

202137,"I'm an ungrateful jerkOriginally posted this in r/depression_help but I thought it would fit in here to.

First things first: I'm a 16y/o boy, who had confrontations with depression (my mother has been suffering them since she was a teenager and raising me alone) with signs of depression showing for about a year now. Recently suicidal thoughts started showing up, with them being present nearly every night now, but I don't harm myself or anything, if I ever had these negative thoughts they were about direct suicide. Not that I'm planning to end myself anytime soon.

As already written in the title, I really feel ungrateful for anything that's happened to me. I got friends, who care about me and also know about my negative thoughts, my mom talked with me about them too, but every time they mention ""getting help"" I instantly block out. It's not like I don't trust people like psychiatrists, it's just...I don't really have any motivation to change anything.

To be honest, I don't really have motivation for anything. Well, ""I'm not motivated enough"" may be an  excuse, I'm honestly rather lazy, or at least I feel so. I only want to do something, if I know I will succeed or  in any way profit from it. And it's blocking me like, a lot. The thing is, when I see that someone is really good at something, I'm not really able to feel happy for them. I just get jealous, even if it's just a cool painting I see or a good text I read. Hell, even if I hear that someone does something I enjoy too. It's like I want to be special at all times. 

Maybe I'm just an attention-seeker but one of the reasons it may be, is that when I was like 6-10, everyone just praised me. That's a really common thing, I know, but I mean like, I always were the best at any exam, I got good grades, knew many things without really working at all. I know this probably sounds like I'm bragging, but I mean it. But maybe that's also just an excuse to put the blame on others. 

Anyway, this ""needing to feel special"" or whatever you may call it, got worse and worse over time. When I'm writing a test in school, I don't want to do anything, if I already know it's not perfect. I don't feel like continuing hobbies, if I don't see an immediate improvement, it's like a combo of giant impatience and perfectionism.

Another thing that's become a real problem in the recent years, is my incredibly short temper, which goes hand in hand with the impatience. I can get frustrated very easily, where its at the point, where I feel like a little kid, getting a temper tantrum (probably exaggerated bit you get the point). 

As for my plans for my future, I really have no idea of what I should do for a living. I try to focus on acting, which I am certain, won't work out, considering I won't have a good reputation with my current grades. And I don't really think I could handle another year of school, which feels like a huge piece of sh*t at this point. So: my options are to apply for an drama-school, which probably won't take me, aiming for a job I don't really like or keeping to got to school, which is like my biggest problem atm.
Although there is a fourth option, that being me just dying, which sounds the most plausible for me to be honest.

I wouldn't wonder if you see me as a huge jerk now, and I do feel like one everytime I think about these characteristics of mine. I'm at the point where I am my least favorite person, who's probably better off just disappearing. I know that people would miss me and I think, if I really am going to end myself, I work try to get them to hate me, because this way they wouldn't really care or at least be less hurt.

Tl;dr: I feel like I'm a ungrateful waste of space, who's never gonna make something out of himself, while being pissed about not being special.

I really don't know what I should do, I know that I should get help to feel better, but I got to little motivation. I would really like, I someone could give me any advise, on how to minder my self-hate or something like that, although I have to admit, that I can't promise, that I will follow that advise.

Also, on a side note, I'm sorry if my English wasn't perfectly correct, I'm actually from Germany and it's my second language, so... yeah",suicide

For the last half year at university I’ve been super alone and I’ve spent almost every afternoons in my room alone making music that no one will want to hear. Ever since then, plus with the virus, I’ve had more time to reflect about what I’ve done with my life and the people that met along the way. I know that all the things I’ve done aren’t bad, hell, I think half of them aren’t bad but I haven’t been able to shake off massive amounts of guilt for just day to day activities. I feel like a crazy person talking about it.

I've been to therapy, but I still feel guilty. There was so much I could have done. For the past two years I've been quite ok with this, his death I mean. I thought I could just power through, I kept busy with work and other things and I kept a very strict routine, so I wouldn't fall into a rabbit hole. But since the beginning of this year I feel like I'm letting everything fall apart. The other day I just realized how empty and lonely I feel. I'm not technically lonely, I have my husband, my parents and my older brother, but still. I feel like something else is missing. I've also realized that since he died I haven't been able to create any bonds with other people. I feel like I'm an alien, so disconnected from everyone else, does anyone else feel like this?

# When you're having a crisis or thinking on hurting yourself the thing that really help is giving it a set time. Like a minute or a hour, a day or month or a year (you choose). If you still want to kill/hurt yourself at the end of that time you can say ok i will do it... but when that set time comes you need to tink, I was a WHOLE minute or hour or day or year fighting and that's a lot. That's a victory in its own way, so you can say more confident if i can go through the double of the time and still want to ending it all i will do it.

I can't afford help, because I have no job, because I'm depressed and socially anxious. I feel like I'm in a cruel cycle of not being able to get the help I need, but unwilling to end it all if it means someone else will have to find me. Life is far too cruel as it is. I don't want to end up being nothing more than something my loved ones have to clean off of a wall and try to distract themselves from when they see just the wrong shade of red. Every day the thought is in my mind. I look at things in my surroundings and think about how practical it would be if that were my weapon of choice.

202201,"Epiphany...Tonight something pretty amazing happened. I had spent the day robotically going through the motions, went to my classes, I did my custodial work, interacted with people; getting everything done while grumbling about the cold and constant rain. But tonight, as I took the trash out from my school lounge to dump it, I stopped dead in my tracks. It was snowing. I had seen snow before-and if you had asked me just minutes before I would have told you I would be happy to never see it again. It is late March in Oregon and I was so ready for Spring weather, but instead we keep getting snow, and I hated it every time. 
But tonight-it caught me by surprise. I looked in awe as the millions of white flakes fell from the sky. I looked up straight into it and became even more astounded as I felt like I was traveling at light speed through space. It was so incredible my eyes actually started to water and goose-bumps covered my skin. My mind tried to comprehend why I had never experienced snow like this before. Then it dawned on me-I had just gotten glasses for my near-sightedness. I was, for the first time, REALLY seeing the snow. I stood there a while longer, and then shook myself out of it and kept working. But as I worked I thought. All my life, I had just expected that I knew what it looked like when it snowed. I thought there was nothing more I could discover about it, no more wonder I could draw from it. It just was what it was. I had not even the slightest idea that I was missing out on something more, that there was more to be seen, that it was so much more beautiful than I could have imagined-because there was no reason to try and imagine it as being more beautiful, I already knew what it looked like-or so I thought. I was wrong. All it took was for me to fix one little thing and suddenly my perspective changed. Things that had always been there, just as they were, were suddenly so much MORE, the snow, the stars, the sunset, the ocean, everything! As I thought, I realized that for so long I have had  this horribly pessimistic view of life, of humanity, of myself. I was convinced that nothing here was worth living for, because it was all crap. But now I am wondering-perhaps it is my perspective that is crap. Perhaps I am taking things for granted, because I am seeing what I expect to see, and through damaged lenses. I am not only seeing things through distorted lenses, but I do not even have hope-because I do not expect, and cannot imagine, that things could be better. Tonight’s experience gave me a little bit of that hope. Maybe if I can fix myself, maybe the world-or at least life- will look just a little more amazing.

Its not that I have a bad life but I often see it as a way of escape if my life goes bad. The last months it feels like I have been thinking about it a lot more. I have never seriously tried to kill myself. I mean 2 years ago I was so tired of my porn addiction that I went to my balcony and got on the railing(im not sure if thats the word english isnt my first language) and sat there thinking about jumping. I am usually very scared to do things like that but I was just tired. That was one time. A couple of weeks ago I was driving my car and I felt so strong that I should drive into a tree. I felt so much guilt and shame for being a very bad person that I felt that it was better to just end it. I have to be honest I got a little worried. I talked to my therapist and a pshyciatrist and I got some medicin for it. They didnt think I was depressed but that I struggle with some compulsive thoughts.   


Today I realized that I dont know if I will ever get free from this porn addiction. If I am going to do it I have to tell my wife all about it and there is a chance she will leave me. THis made me think about suicide again. If she leaves me and find someone else I would be happy for her but I think about ending it if that happens. I am absolutely not telling her about this.

I'm non-functional. 

I tried to build myself a better life, but I failed as I fail at doing anything. I have nothing to be proud of, nothing to look foward to. I'm going to drop uni for my grades and that was the only thing that mattered to me. 

It's not that I'll never be happy in the future, is that everything will go this way because I'm broken and I cannot be fixed. And I'm tired of failing at everything. 

I only want to sleep all day.

This is not life. Life is doing what you want, not what your illness allow you to. 

I'll do it at my first occasion of when I'm alone, I already have a plan. Take months worth of painkillers, some alchol, cut my wrist and take some warfarin, so even if they cure me for the cuts they won't figure out the overdosing. Or I'll bleed to death before they can even notice.

I'll suffer for 10 minutes instead of a whole fucking life. This is a bargain. 10 minutes vs a lifetime. I'll take the 10.  I hope I won't fail this too, as I failed everything else.

I hope I'll die. Soon. I'm feeling disappointed that I wake up in the morning at all. 

I don't know if I should wait for the 20th, I have to see my psych. But I'm tired. Every single day I'm tired even more. I cannot keep living like this. She will probably just up or change my meds. And few months from now nothing will change, because I'll be always stuck at the same fucking point of being nothing and worthless and having everything I care about took away from me.  
I never asked to be alive, why I should keep hoping that my life will improve, even if I know it won't work? Living for the sake of others is stupid. 

People will miss me, but who cares. They will be better without me anyway. No stupid, useless and lame me to care about anymore.

I would like to see my LDR boyfriend for the last time,  but... No. I won't wait. I'll go at the first occasion I get. Then I won't be able to do it until the end of August and I cannot see myself be alive for another week. The thought of August is dreadful. No, the next day I'm home alone I'll do it.

202243,"Had a huge mental breakdown two hours ago because of several things that happened throughout the day.My day started of quite bad. I got called by my best friend (male) at midnight. He sounded totally shitfaced. There were a lot of background noise and a lot of talking. He asked me if I was awake and alone at 00:15. Which I said ""yes?"" to. I had no idea what was going on. Then all of a sudden a girl started talking to him and hung up the phone. Cue panic attack. Like wtf was that all about. I texted him ""okay?"" about fifteen minutes later.

Around five I woke up because I felt like I was going to throw up and saw that I had two unread messages from him. In an almost unreadable text he said ""huh, have I called you? Oof"" (translated from another language).

I wasn't able to sleep for almost an hour because ya ""boi"" had another panic attack while in bed.

Then I woke up at around 14:45 I woke up because I had to pee. Dropped my phone on my way to the bathroom and found out that my bank card is gone. (Card is supposed to be in the little pocket on the case). Went upstairs to tell mom, while having a full on panic attack, only to find my aunt and grandmother in the living room. Guess who decided to invite family over for dinner without telling me (and mom).

I have been diagnosed with autism, so the change in my plans caused an even bigger panic attack. Yay me.

Three hours later (after dinner), a different ""friend"" sent me a long video of him lip syncing to ""make you mine"" by PUBLIC. I hate getting videos of him. It makes me sick to my stomach. You may think ""what's the problem here?"". He's in his thirties. I'm still a couple of years away from 20. I've told him so many times I don't want him as a boyfriend. (1 because of age difference. 2 We live in different countries. 3 I'm into girls.)

So anyway, after I had to painstakingly watch my way through that video, I sent him a snap saying ""I do not enjoy videos from you"". He read it wrong and thought I said that I do enjoy getting videos from him. Se sent the video in chat and saved it together with a cheesy paragraph basically saying ""since you loved the video so much I'll save it here so you can watch it whenever you're feeling down. I love you lots.""
After I corrected him, he got all sad and said ""well shit 💔"". I muted him again at that point.

A few hours passed and I thought that was it for the day, but oh boy were I wrong. I watched a r/wholesomememes video by The Click. I thought it'd make me happy, but it just made me cry more and more. That's what happens when you bottle up emotions for months. At the end of the video I was just full on ugly crying. I put on my favourite album by xxxtentacion, as you do when you see no end to your suffering. I ended up ugly crying for half an hour while listening to 17 on repeat.

After I cleaned up my tears and blew my nose, I just sat at my bed for a while. Tried to watch videos, but I just felt dead. No spark in my eyes, no smile, no laughter, no emotion. Just dead, but breathing.

Then I cut myself. Once, twice, more and more, the blood started dripping quicker and quicker. I stopped and got some paper towels because, ya know, don't want to leave any blood on the clean bedsheets.

So here I am. I failed the ""no self harm"" goal I made for 2020. Just spent an hour typing this. Even though probably nobody's going to see it.",suicide

202249,"Feeling traumatized after EMDRTLDR; had my first in person session with a new therapist who immediately launched into EMDR with me over my most visceral childhood trauma memory. Wondering if it’s normal to start such intense work with a stranger. Feeling incredibly suicidal (tried to post in r/EMDR but it would not allow me to). 

I had my first EMDR session today and I feel like I have been traumatized all over again. 

First of all, this therapist is brand new to me. I have had one prior appointment with her via FaceTime (on Friday). I really liked her on the phone, gave her some of my back story, she told me EMDR could help process some childhood trauma and I was very excited to meet her in person today. 

When I walked into the office, she asked me if I liked a poster she’d bought. I told her yes. She asked how my day was, I said fine. Then she asked if I was ready to start EMDR. I said sure, I have no idea what the process looks like and assumed she knew best. 

She went through a few things first, find a safe place, body scan, identify safe people and one protector. Then, she asked me to recall my most vivid childhood trauma memory. She had me walk myself through it in my own head while tapping, told me what a good job I was doing, and reminded me to breathe throughout. Second body scan. Then go back to the memory with your safe people. 

I completely dissociated. I realized at one point my eyes were open but I couldn’t see anything. I could hear her but had no idea where I was. She told me to stop tapping and I completely lost my shit. She gave me about two minutes to calm down then went right back to trying to process through how I would save the child, how would I rescue her, what would my safe people say if they walked in? 

I would never want anyone to walk in. Those memories are my dark hole. I’d never wish that stuff on anyone else. 

She led me through the wrap up stuff and remarked on how “anxious” I looked. No shit Karen. 

I literally feel a thousand times worse than I did before I started. I know trauma work is difficult, but I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced a therapist deciding to use EMDR on their first or second appointment? I don’t feel I have the coping skills to process what happened today.

At the time I take these overdoses or poison I think it isformaldehyde or something similar I do not know it is happening, it is not me doing it. Or is part of me, a fraction, blocked instantly by my fully aware mind. I didnot know I dissociated like this but apparently everyone else can but not me, I have to die because I can never get help. 

People are trying to kill me because they think I am a pedophile or that I am intentionally hurting other people. I am being threatened by someone that they will put childporn on my laptop if I go to the police or that they will put me in jail. Tney have killed my nan. They are threatening me about my mum &amp; dad. Someone is using me to have sex. I think my dad or someone else is raping me or something is happening around my dad's house.

I am hallucinating but they are using the hallucinations to program me to be a pedophile or so I do sex acts with my family. i.e/e.g whatevs I am watching the t.v, a male voice is talking to my dad telling him to imagine parting her lips, my lips. I want to spew to run away but I can't I am trapped. I hear no actual voice, it is hidden behind a colour, no voice but a male presence says that is a child now. Before nothing. No voice. No arousal. Now arousal. I think they are getting off on the fact they can abuse me like this. Apparently the strongest orgasm she has ever had. I am the pedophile now &amp; must die. 

They keep talking to me calling me a bitch, or a pedophile or asking what I did to cat (I do not know, which Cat?) If I drink wine then they are threatening me saying that they will be round with the poison late r (they have a wife) They have poisoned my family &amp; I think some of my friends too. They ask why I am not dead yet I think they are trying to kill me by giving me cancer but very slowly. I don't know why they would do this it is like a game or powerplay or some form of revenge.

 Everytime I try to get help it just makes it worse. I tried to get help from a worker at the hospital he said ""just tell the voices/colours that you are a pedophile"" - they announced themselves to me as pedophiles but now I see with however many turns even I will say that too. 

 I think some of them work at the hospital, with the police or on the 111 emergency line. Even the mental health practioners or psychiatrists do not want to help. 

I got a job &amp; moved &amp; they were even going on about it at work. My manager at work. Saying ""you are a pedophile"" plain as day. At fucking work. As if it was normal everyday whatever """"You. Are. A. Pedophile. """" like who even fucking says that??! Anyway I was off sick &amp; got fired because I couldn't cope with that amount of SERIOUSLY WTF DUDE DIDYOU JUST SAYINFRONT OF A WHOLE RESTAURANT OFPAYING FUCKI G CUSTOMERS!!!? 

I can't have my house because my housemate is in on it. I can't have my dog because I think I raped her or they want me to think I raped her on videophone. I want to live at my dad's but I can't because he talks to himself &amp; I think the above is actually happening the incest &amp; dog/me rape. Maybe he is poisoning me or letting them in whoever they are. Maybe it is Danny (an ex) as he has cameras everywhere in his house, was talking on the phone about this ""cat"" (but which cat?) I can't trust anyone but do anyway. Like a total dumbass. I think I am dissociating so that people think they can do this to me. 

Then I am sotting in a blue person but It is not cat it is daisy or lucy calling me a nasty bitch.

 I don't know why a person would say ""if I get you again I will kill you"" &amp; then there I am taking overdoses or eating shower gel without knowing about it. 

Wby am I not dead yet? I think that's all they want to know. 

I am also being injected, given needles, threatened with knives, guns &amp; have people coming into my house, maybe even feeding me cigarettes at their behest. Against my will as I am in a state of dissociation. Apparently I am a pedophile. But as many fucks as I have years doesn't count. 

The whole of facebook looks like it is set up against me. I had it drummed into my head by voices in hospital that I couldn't talk to facebook. I don't know if it means a person with *that* blue aura or typing things into facebook formy so called &amp; thusly isolated friends to not reply to. 

My phone types... I choose the middle word *tap* *tap* *tap* the 'random' words form scentences:

My phone is totally broken just have to wait till I get it now can you bring a spare hair band if you have a good weekend and I have the next day Idk what to do to appease them or get along with the poison (autocorrected gastroenterologist with poison) My phone is totally broken just have to wait till I get it now can you bring a spare hair band if it is male or female or human or whatnot I'm not sure about the after party with some random french festivals. My phone is totally broken just have to wait till I get it now can you bring a spare hair band if you have a good weekend and I have the next day Idk what to do to appease them or get along with the gastroenterologist soon so that might be worth a look. I don't know what if anything that even means. I thought they were giving me crack. The police said I was a catch. They said I was from the chase earlier. I am apparently racist now so when they laughed I called one of them a pakki. There is someone called nick, maybe the person whose voice I could hear, or maybe the guy at the hospital that said textbook &amp; pd problem &amp; made my nana have a stroke. Maybe there is a nick who is a policeman. Apparently there is a nick who is gay. Some orange &amp; white or beige person was either telling a story that I was the pedophile or that the poilice had caught the pedophile &amp; it was me. Funny how it doesn't happen in the ambulance. But they always want to put me in the police van. For show. For the story. If I am a pedophile then why would they need to threaten me with it in the first place? ""I'm going to turn you into a pedophile if... blah blah blah"" says a mans voice. Once it was for smoking. Another time for soending too long in the shower. Who has such power? 

But I never get it. So I must die. Now. Or in the night. Bleeding slowly into my mattress after my housemate comes in in the night to cut me some more after I make just 1 shallow cut.  Really get an artery this time. Well done my housemate. He is the stronger sex. The fitest. I shall die or else learnmy lesson. Learn my lesson this time. I want to know why I can't learn my lesson for somehow through all off this I am still alive. 

Or maybe I shall actually do as he/they like/want me too. Maybe I should be French &amp; classy &amp; throw myself in front of a train, for an audience. Adios world, I have been fat which was someone's dog apparently. I hold this blade wondering why I can't cut deep enough. &amp; I drank poisoned/tainted wine. But I am also so hungry I could just eat &amp; passout. 

Just another melodrama, the damage to my organs putiing me closer to death than the tiny blade resting in my closed palm ""I wanked off a boy"" reels through my head. ""You made her come ******, you made her a pedophile"" &amp; allnI can now think about is food &amp; my aching poisoned guts. If you wrote this before me then I am sorry that I stumbled upon your path to tell my tall tale of absolution &amp; revenge (not mine of course). They have got me, whatever I am so I will be dead soon ""I must die now"" so I guess a last meal or hospital visit is in order. Oh sorry, apparently ""I am THE pedophile"" so I can't get help, whatever that means, I don't understand. 

""The pedophile"" perhaps they should call CNN &amp; BBC news. Maybe I should knock on doors down the street? Save them a job surely. They are still calling me the pedophile. 

As this is apparently a competion I will leave you now. I have my razor &amp; tainted wine. 

TL:DR I have a razor blade (from a good disposable razor) but my poisoner (see above) would rather see me suffer longer than be able to use it now. ",suicide

My mom attempted suicide this weekend. On Friday she took 60 Ativans all at once and expected not to wake up. She left a note. My parents have been going through a difficult divorce and she cited this as the reason for what she did. She took the pills Friday, and was apparently passed out (or comatose, we'll never know) all day Saturday. I live with her usually but I was at my Dad's for the weekend.

I got a weird text (unintelligible) from her Sunday morning and remembered that she had been prescribed this Ativan on Thursday and was worried she was going to try to drive, so I headed home at 6:30 AM and that was when I found her and took her to the hospital.
I guess basically I'm still in crisis control mode. Because my parents are separated and my siblings are either far away or minors, I was the one in control of the whole situation, or trying to be. I think I still have the adrenaline thing going on. I haven't cried yet. I feel like some sort of professional trying to deal with this from the outside. I don't even know what I feel except pretty angry, which I guess is natural. I'm angry that she felt the need to end her life and that she knew I would be the one to find her.

If I'm all numb now...does that mean I'm going to have a breakdown later? I don't want to. I mean, truly, is it healthy for me to feel this disconnected? I feel like everyone around me is crying and everything and I feel almost nothing, or like my body is trying to protect me from the truth. I remember when one of my friends died, his brother dealt with it kind of the same way and he's all fucked up now. I don't want that to happen.

My mom is in a psych ward for now until they release her. She is trying to bust out of there ASAP. I don't want her to but she has her rights and after 48 hours she can do whatever she wants if the doctors deem her well enough to check out.

**Edit** I think it is finally starting to set in now, but slowly. I went in to work today but had to leave 2 hours early because my brain just kind of shut off and I put my head on my desk and stared for awhile. I work with special needs kids and knew I couldn't have a breakdown in front of them. Haven't had a breakdown yet but I will definitely get some sleep. And I'm actually kind of thinking I shouldn't be driving, as weird as that sounds. It was very hard for me to focus on the road and I felt nervous not going reeeeeeally slow.

Right now I just really want to go after the idiot psychiatrist who prescribed her 60 Adivans (a new medication for her) without having physically seen her in 3 months. Just called in the prescriptions. The psych won't answer my calls or messages and I'm sure it's because she is worried about losing her license.",suicide

I became quite anxious reversed fearful and the thought of suicide terrified me. What about the pain, what about the consequences, what about the people who count on me and the list of concern is going on.

A person with such mindset can't possibly pull through something like suicide. Way to fearful.

But now it changed. It noticed my anxiety that appeared last year worsens when I take Tyrosine. I stopped taking it and there's this stoic calm again that I had in 2018.

Worlds of difference and what confidence it gives me. I have no emotions. That's the difference I think.

So I feel in a position that I could drive up there and do what I planned for quite a long time.

I won't quarrel about God,and faults of people and the possibilities of getting better and that there's more to life and bla bla bla.

The causes are as follows:
A) I failed the math part of my TSI which could cause me to not get into the college program I want. I already took remedial math and I still failed and if I cant get into this program I will literally never be happy because it its absolutely what I want to do with my life.

B) I have fucking bed bugs. And a nasty rash from their bites.

C) I watch my husbands family put his brothers and their wives on a pedestal and treat them so well and my husband and I are tossed aside because his religous belief is not theirs.

D) My in laws never gave us a wedding gift or card, and literally told us they were not happy about our wedding yet on the day of they acted like it was the greatest day of their life. I hate fake people.

E) All my friends live too far away for me to jusy drive and see them and its starting to become extremely lonely.

F) Politics.

G) Someone who I thought was my friend has just been using me.

H) My husband has this family that claims Family is everything, yet obviously theyre not. But my family is literally bat shit insane and I cant stand them so it makes me so sad that we are basically us against the world.

202366,"Emotionless, just plain tired of life.Not sure what I'm expecting to happen by posting here, but I wanted to say something to someone. I've never talked to anyone about this stuff. I've been depressed my entire life and have had suicidal thoughts even when I was like 10-11. I have an appointment to see a counselor in two weeks but I don't know if I'll make it. 

Every day I try and go into work, do just enough to prevent being fired (lately barely enough), come home and either drink until I black out or surf for questionable porn (nothing illegal, just fucked up).  Essentially, the same thing I've done since I was about 17 (I'm 32 now). I've done the odd interesting thing and a shitload of volunteer work in the community, but I really think my best times are well behind me. I'm bored, tired of the grind and I don't think I can take another 30+ years of this. I'm emotionless, significant things have happened to people around me, but I feel nothing. My dad survived cancer a few years ago. My best friend's mom died of cancer, and I still didn't feel anything for someone whom I knew for the majority of my life. I'm not an alcoholic, I go weeks without drinking. I just do it because I'm bored, and it allows me to feel *something*. How pathetic is that. Everything I enjoyed doing before is no longer fun. I hang out with friends just because I always have, but I don't specifically enjoy it anymore. I just have a bunch of drinks and go through the whole rigmarole for nothing. 

On top of that, it's pretty fucking pathetic in 2013 that I'm still in the closet, but I'm terrified to come out to my parents and brother. I don't want to be the gay son, the failure that won't keep the family name going. I work alongside one of my parents so it's not like they wouldn't be reminded every day. My extended family would never accept that so it's better to avoid it altogether. It's certainly fucked up any chance of a relationship. My last relationship was 10 years ago. It wasn't my first fling but it was certainly the most significant. We had made plans to move half way across the country so we could try living together openly without our parents and friends finding out. I made it out there first, he was supposed to follow a few weeks later but he was killed instantly by a drunk driver in his hometown. I was devastated, I was broke and couldn't come back for the funeral, and I couldn't bring myself to ask my parents for help. I couldn't hide my grief, and they don't know I'm gay, I pretended it was a girlfriend that died. I felt like such a fucking traitor to his memory. Eventually the frustration and guilt of it lead me to being picked up by the police as I was sitting on the edge of my 5th floor apartment balcony, willing myself to jump off. I spent a night in the hospital, and soon after I moved back to my hometown and have been aimless ever since.

So here I am a decade later, in no better shape. I've done some cool shit since, but again, it's not enjoyable anymore and I'm not seeing the upswing of sticking around any longer. I know it's a selfish move that will affect my family significantly, but in this case I want to just look out for #1 here. I'm hoping the grief would be balanced out by joy in the fact that my brother has really gotten his shit together and is getting married in the summer. It's not that I specifically want to die, it's just the only option that I think would stop me from feeling like shit all the time. I wonder if my parents know I'm so unhappy and tired and maybe they would consider it a mercy killing or something.

Anyway, I'm going to bed. I'll figure out what to do tomorrow. Thanks for reading this shit. Sorry for rambling.",suicide

202368,"I don't know how to continueI was molested, beaten, had a gun put to my head when I was 5, watched my mom get beaten for 3 years during my childhood, and have struggled to continue to live.

I'm currently a senior in college.  I'm a little older than other students because I had a late start.  I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ptsd recently.  The therapist said I would need counseling for many years.  I was taking several medications which helped some, but had some side effects including insomnia.  I never made it back to the doctor to follow up and get another prescription, and things have spiraled downhill since.  

I last took medicine and saw a therapist about a month ago.  Now I feel worse off than I was previously.  It's so hard to force myself to go get help.  I'm so ashamed of myself, my life, and how everything has turned out.  I never had thoughts of harming myself until tonight.  I couldn't bring myself to do it though because I love my family too much.  I haven't been to class since I stopped taking the medicine, just locked myself in my apartment.  I have the most supportive mother in the world, but I can never talk to her about my problems because she blames herself.  I don't feel comfortable talking to the therapist at school, and had to skip a lot of subjects that I didn't want to talk about.  I don't want to talk to other family or friends because they've always relied on me, not the other way around.

I recently tried to talk to one of my childhood abusers who I hadn't seen in 22 years.  I wanted an apology or some sign of remorse, and I didn't get it.  I wanted to be able to forgive her.  She's my father's ex-wife whom he married after him and my mom separated.  I hoped that aging from 28 years old to 50 years old would have allowed her to mature and have regrets, but it didn't.  She mocked me.  She said horrible, untrue things about myself, my family, my mom...and then she pretended that she didn't know who I was and said I ""must have the wrong person because she's never beaten or threatened to kill any child.""  I wish I had never tried to do that.  It was a huge mistake. 

I don't know if I can continue school at the moment.  I know there are options to withdraw and take some time off and come back to it, but I already had to do that once a couple years ago as a sophomore.  I don't want to disappoint my family.  The self-isolation has crippled me to the point that I don't feel comfortable leaving my apartment.  I know what I need to do, I know that I need to go back to the doctor, take medicine, continue therapy, and withdraw from school until I can sort myself out.  But I can't bring myself to do that.  I already feel like a failure, and I've already had a chance to get help and failed so quickly.  I don't even deserve another chance.",suicide
202369,"I want it all to endI've been fighting anxiety all my life and depression. I'm so tired of fighting. I can't get help because of the stigma that surrounds parents with mental illnesses. I don't want to be labelled a threat to my toddler even though I do my best to take great care of my kid. I'd rather die than be an abuser. I grew up being abused physically and my mom still emotionally abuse me. She says I'm selfish and a bad person for being depressed and needing to take medication. My husband is controlling and is sick of dealing with my mental health problems. He doesn't want me getting help because he doesn't want social services involved again. 
My child deserves a happy mom and unfortunately that's not who I am. I don't know if I'll ever be that person.  I hope God can forgive me for feeling like this because I sure can't forgive myself.",suicide

For me it’s one, my mother is still alive, and two, method. My mother was recently diagnosed with cancer, and had surgery. She’s 85 years old, and likely doesn’t have many years left. My suicide would devastate her. 

Two, is how I would end my life. I want a clean, not-too-painful death. I plan on overdosing when my time is up. I read suicides by overdoses are rarely successful. Perhaps most attempts are poorly thought out and do not take enough of the right drugs, or change their mind when they still can. 

I have 75 10/325 Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen tablets and 12 muscle relaxant tablets left over from a recent surgery. I am confident this dosage would be sufficient. My only reluctance is the acetaminophen dosage would ruin my liver should I survive the initial attempt. Or just draw out the overdose from ‘going to sleep and not waking up’ to a slow, painful death over a few days.

I found out that everything is subjective, we don't mean anything at the same time we mean everything, there is no one and nothing that can confirm it to us; we just confirm or deny it to ourselves depending on our culture/life and experience. I don't consider myself a handsome guy and I get frustrated with my laziness and irresponsibility/incapability of being the best, and I know how silly it sounds. My parents are divorced and I went through some deceptions in my life, not enough to make me suicide, though. When I think it's just takes a knoose or a jump to end any compromise I have to attend or any suffering I have yet to pass through, It really makes me think why the fuck not.

My mother has been an alcoholic for 5+ years now and I've known about it for 2 or 3 years. My sisters have been abusive to her in the past because she wouldn't let them get their own way and she feels like a failed mother which I think is quite a big reason for her drinking (and her father dying who was her rock and her mother's death will make her feel alone). Whenever she gets money she will buy vodka and drink it till she falls asleep (although there have been times when she's stayed awake and drank....once she nearly burnt the house down and today we went shopping and she took a drink with her and hid it in her bag). She's seen a counsellor and they couldn't help, she's been to support groups and she said they don't help, I've tried to support her and be there for her to talk to and inspire her and it hasn't really helped at all. We've thought about rehab but we can't afford it.

Now I got a gf, more friends that I can hang out with more often and my school is going better. Only my depression isn’t. 

Every single day I call my gf for like 3 hours but I just can’t be with her Bcs she lives too far away. It’s apparently really bad when you can’t be with a person you love. I sometimes even hurt myself to get distracted from wanting to be with her so much. 

I also make music which helps with not thinking about her. Only the problem is she sings really good and has a yt channel where she covers songs. So every time I make something I think about her and how her voice would fit my track really well. 

I really don’t know what to do about it I have to go to school for like 1,5 more years and idk if I could wait that long. I just want to be with her so much that I yesterday just punched a hole in my closed door. 

Please if someone knows how to get distracted from her tell me. Idk what to do my life got so much better I got a gf, friends and I’m working out again after 3 years. Only my mind doesn’t want to believe it for some reason so I stay depressed.

202425,"Read this if you are feeling Suicidal. I hope I can help.Everyone who is looking at this is either contemplating suicide, or has contemplated it before. I am one of you people, and I want to tell me story to help others.

I was put into school a year early due to my ""Smarts"". I could pick up things rather easily if said things were artistic. Having this intellect is a curse. It makes one see the world for what it is, and you don't have the option of ""ignorance is bliss"". 

Because I was younger and also a ""Late bloomer"" I was shorter then everyone in my class. A boy named Jake became my friend in kindergarten. After a few weeks, Jake began bullying me relentlessly. He hit me with berserk comments and horrible names that stung my sensitive heart. After a few years of this, I had made alot of friends. One of them, Al, was truly a very close friend.

He and I would ignore Jake's comments together and were very tight. One day, however, Al jumped onto Jake's side, and he joined in the brutal assault aswell.

While this betrayal made me quite sad, it had not yet made me suicidal.

At this point, it was 8th grade. I was the least popular kid in school, and I was just trying to get by. I tried making friends with a skater gang, but that didn't really help as they kept pushing me away.

The bullying got worse and worse, and no matter what I did they kept bombarding me. One day I had enough.

I had a plan, to go home and hang myself with my bed sheets. That, or I would jump out a 2nd story window head first onto concrete, whichever came first.

I was going to do it, but then I mentioned it to one of my skater friends. He instantly brought me into the boy's bathroom along with the other skater friends I had made and gave me an intervention for me to cry and confess in. They gave me hugs and comfort.

I told them not to tell the Counselor at school, I didn't want to go. Sure enough, one period later, I was called down. They cared about me enough to know when to disregard what I had said.

I got therapy, counseling and all kinds of help.

Since that faithful day, I had slowly come out of my melancholy state, and each day got better. I made all kinds of new friends and became more popular. I did this through optimism.

HOW DOES THIS HELP YOU? Because I'm going to tell you what I realized.

Life is crap. It is enduring through pain. Some do it better than others and some just get lucky. But we all are lucky.

We all have life, something some creatures could never have, or can never have again. The baby that dies in the womb must envy us so, being trapped without even the beginning of their existence. Thousands die each day prematurely. Next time you watch the news about some 14 year old getting killed in a bus crash, realize you still have your life. YOU own something that others less fortunate don't. To throw away such a thing by killing yourself would be wasteful, and staying in depression and pessimism is just as wasteful.

Remember how I said that i couldn't have ""Bliss through ignorance""? I have achieved bliss through enlightenment. And not through religion, though faith does help.

Just realize that life is a glorious gift. According to science, the only reason that we have life is because at the beginning of the universe, two unlikely molecule created the big bang and started the ever expanding system we know today. To know that the reason we exist is because of a freak occurring really makes you think ""Wow, it's lucky I'm alive right now""

For those of you with true, deep depression, please at least try to do this, I know it is hard, but at least try.

My situation got infinitely better, and so will yours. Just give karma a chance. Thank you Reddit, and godspeed.",suicide

It hadn't struck me before, not as it did today. There was anguish that bled and squirmed, it was pain, it was alive. An anger too, scorching, but insidious, an advisor, worn and bent, whispering in my ear.

It's mud now. It is sorrow without pain, rotting. No poetry. Prosody died - not a funeral to honor it. Hope mangles as nothing else can. It slashes, rips, tears, shatters; it eats all that dares to be at peace.

I know the drums now, that beat until all is numb, I know what they write, the endless pacing from the death that walks. I have rooms of my own, sometimes I see color. Do you see it too? I know no one who does. They take my sight.

I saw nothing today. I peered into its eyes. It smiled, demure, seen. I gripped its arm. It didn't breathe at all. It was every mother's son. Sing, my boy, sing, why won't you sing? It is not quiet. Racket. Lest I can't hear.

202496,"Copy of a letter to my psychotherapist and psychiatrist~~I think I need help and I'm sorry to come back but I don't know if I can wait til Thursday.~~

I'm going to write this down because I can't bring myself to say any of these things in any of our sessions. It just feels odd.

I feel fundemantaly broken and I can never focus my thoughts, ever. Everything always feels broken and I feel I'd rather die than live. I've only held off on killing myself because I wanted to hold on to the chance that somehow discussing this will be beneficial. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I hate myself and who I am. I hate the fact that the medication and talking therapies won't ever work for me because I'm meant to be like this. Every single part of my life is ruined beyond repair. I'm a liar and a polydrug abuser. Every time I dream I never want to wake up, even the most horrible dreams seem like fucking heaven every single time. I'm nothing and I feel the only way I can ever rectify this is by reducing myself to nothing. I feel like I lie unconciously every time we meet (As with Dr Serrano) as my mind puts out blockades and won't let me voice how I really feel so there's a dilated, overthought and over styled delivery of how I really feel. Mediated and watered down. I'm lucid now and I know there's something fucked in my head too, Dr Serrano always tells me it's just anxiety but I know I've been having delusional thoughts and seeing things that aren't real. My Guardian Angel always stands with me, never speaking, now I can recognise this as being the case but these momnents of insight are getting smaller and smaller. I ended up crying in my friends flat this weekend because my flat was covered in thick black bugs, pulsating and crawling everywhere so I could barely recognise that which is mine. I look in the mirror and the face I see isn't mine anymore, this is less and less of a momentary situatino and it's becoming real life. My Guardian Angel is always with me, standing stoic and still and I can't begin to comprehend why He has chosen me. All the dread and fear he instills in me does nothing but make him grown until he consumes everything. His sole intention is to hurt me or to drive me to hurt myself. I've not been using any drughs besides Venlafaxine and this is in no means any form of detox or drug induced state (directly) and I can't escape it. I can't sleep because of what He'll do to me when I can't guard myself. The idea that I will sleep and unwittingly transfer him to those who live near me fills me with disgust and stronger self loathing. Even in these momnents when I'm lucid the knowledge that He will return is too strong to bear. I can't distract myself or remove myself from these situations because these situations are me. I'm writing this on Sunday night, I can't sleep because when I sleep I can't control my thoyghts and they can transfer to others. I cut myself on an almost daily basis, sometimes thoughts burst out and take a form on my flesh, other times I hack at myself until I'm a bloody mess. It doesn't make him fuck off anymore than it ever did. And I lied and said self injury is in no means helpful but that's not true and it never will be. I need to hurt myself so He can't. I'm not Iain Jack anymore, I'm a scarred, empty shell that inhabits. Dr Serrano said to talk to my Guardian Angel but I can't, every time I does he stands deeply rooted and doesn't respond but I can hear him inside me. There are mental arguments all the time and I talk so often in order to get rid of them and to drown out the voices, I take subutex, heroin fucking methadone like a hideous little junky bwecause when I do I can drift away from Him. I know I'm rational because I can say that 1 and 1 = 2, if I was insane I couldn't form rational thought. This fear is too real as well, it's not possible that I could hae this prolonged fear when He doesn't exist. I don't talk about Him because I'm not fucking crazy and this is what crayz people would say. This thought alone proves I'm rational and sound of mind. If this isn't real, if this is all a conjuration then maybe I deserve it and shouldn't try to be helped? If this happened it's because I used drugs.I know you tell me not to overthink things but I can't avoid this, my mind doesn't work properly and is sapped in to  this. I know these momnents when I'm lucid are becoming less and less common and I'm going to drop in to oblivion, I don't know if I can stop myself from experiencing this. I stared at my Venlafaxine which I had been saving up for a long time when He made me come off them (this wasn't recently) and it's so easy to take them, I counted and I have 5 months supplied as well as a month and ah alf i am using now. If I were to take them all I could escape everything that's ever in my head. I have no one I can talk to this about and I would lie to you about how this actually happens when I see you because He makes me defend Him. I honestly don't know what to do. I can only hold out til Thursday but I don'ty want to demean you but there's nothing that can fix this to me. I had to write this because I could never say this.

It was difficult to check if I got the vein with only one hand, as I needed to pull up slightly to draw blood.

**How:** constant downing of one Xanax pill at a time, a swing of booze, repeat until one is gone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why:** I just can't take this pain that I feel from the love of my life / boyfriened / ex boyfriend / shitty person - all the same person.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background (if don't want to know, skip down):** 

Known each other since we were young kids. I loved him for years, he ended up marrying the wrong girl not me. Fast forward 13 years we reconnect and instantly fall in love, which was a long time coming. Especially since he told me he loved me when we were young and now and it should of been me he chose.

&amp;#x200B;

We have been dating for 3 years. After the first year and a half, we broke up. I got distant, as I am busy in grad school, and am very independent and need space. I have hobbies, driven, passions, interest, friends, goals, etc. He has no friends, no goals, no purpose. So a lot of the time he looked to me for fulfillment in his life. And as soon as I was busy, stressed, couldn't be a fantastic girlfriend all the time (yes grad school breakdowns are real, and I was reeling from depression from an abortion). These are all things I tried to make him understand but at times he didn't, but we both acted toxic sometimes, depressed sometimes, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the first time I got 'distant' a year and a half into our relationship, he started seeing a new girl behind my back, and when I found out I LOST it. I would go over and stand outside his house for hours in the winter telling him how I feel, depressed, stressed, how much I love him, what we can do to get better. He chose her, as he said she ""was a fun exciting option he wasn't going to pass up"". Fast forward, a month and a half later, I decided to go home that day from work and kill myself. Right before I did, he called me. Talked to me forever. Called me every day after that until he came over my house 3 days later saying he broke up with her and wanted me. She was a rebound and he never liked her. I never told him I was planning to kill myself. However, after he was about a guy friend I had that would periodically make advances on me, but I never made advances on him. So for the next two months, he would hang out with this rebound ex of his and rub it in my face while I saw at his house crying waiting for him to come home.

&amp;#x200B;

For the next year or so we were up and down. Good months, bad months. Good summer as I had a break from grad school, but then after grad school started he became obsessed with spending every waking moment at his parent's house. (He has 2 kids, and a house himself). To the point where every day I could hang he would say he's just going to hang at his parents. Fast forward. He never came to my grandpas funeral so I didn't hang out with him 3 days later at Christmas because I was mad. mad his priority that day was to go shopping with his parents and never stop at the funeral. At the start middle of February, he got mad one night I went out with my friends, and broke up with me for not calling that night before passing out. I got mad he kept breaking up with me when he was mad. So I told him were not just getting back together, but have to talk and work on things. For the first 3 weeks he couldn't take it, he wanted to be with me again right then, and said waiting shows I wasn't sure. Then the last 3 weeks, he built a shrine of my things in his living room. So i began texting him more trying to work things out and NOT argue. But he always defaults to arguing. Then last week I went over, was going to stay the night, and when he tried to have sex, I said, not yet, we need to take this slower, he got mad and told me to leave. The week after that we talked here and there but I was angry and we argued. Finally the other day I'm like I'm sick of arging. Let's just stop, really work on our problems, maybe therapy, be honest, and I wrote him a 6 page letter being very mature and explaing what we could activiely do to really mkae this work. Then he blocked me and has me blocked for 2 days. This is something he does. often.

&amp;#x200B;

What his habits are: whenever I seem to be over it or just need time away form arguing or him stressing me out, I step back, and he comes in full force, coming to my house in the middle of the night, texting me, calling me, whatever. Whenever he steps away, says he's done, like he did 2 days ago and blocked me, I throw myself to my knees begging. Literally outside his house for hours (can't say how many times he's locked me out in the deaed of winter), text, calls, etc. It seems like he likes that I want him, even though he said he was done, he built a shrine and invited me over a week ago. This kid loves me, but he thinks I'm the only one doing things wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now:** I wasn't a great girlfriend. First I'm an INTP so I'm not heavily into displaying emotions. But I have VERY deep emotions and an over-thinking brain that drives me insane every day of my life. But he wasn't a great boyfriend either. We could argue who did worse, but I never cheated. I never wanted anyone but him even though he has self-love issues (again no friends, no hobbies, relying on me for his happiness).

&amp;#x200B;

**What I would do wrong:** he said I never made him a priority. But grad school is difficult. I'm in an extensive program. One morning after a beautiful happy weekend, I went to school then stayed out and went out to dinner, fell asleep at my friend's house and never called. He got angry the next morning and broke up with me. Then instantly wanted me to get back and I got mad that he keeps saying he's ""done"" every time he is ""mad"" at me about things I don't feel he should be mad about, or that mad about, not to break up with someone you constantly say you want to marry. Grad school is hard, it's not an excuse, but 3 weeks ago I made him cookies he wouldn't accept them. I went to his house and he kicked me out. When we together I hang out with him all the time. I even told him the day he last broke up with me that I want to go have a special night out, as he loves that.

&amp;#x200B;

What else: who knows. It's not as bad as last year when he chose that other girl for a month and a half, but I think he'll come around? however, Idk and I can't take waiting and being in pain. I don't deal with heartbreak well, but I never ever have wanted to kill myself to stop this pain from someone besides him. And this is my third time feeling like this. So I was thinking about doing it at his house before he gets home from work. I know it sounds dumb, but I love him and I was to be within any bit of his presence. I love him... Why can't he just unblock me, and tell me he wants to work on being happy too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, considering to aim for 4 days. Tuesday is the perfect day, plus its beautiful to sit outside and pop and drink for an hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Any suggestions on different ways? Questions? Additional helpful methods?** 

The first time I wanted to he knew about and told me please don't because he truly loves me. I'm not killing myself to get him back, I just can't take the pain that is caused my us.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

Yet right now she's doing that, she's literally sleeping with all the most notorious fuckbois and I'm kinda worried that she's gonna catch a disease or get pregnant or something. 

Sure it could just be that she was lying when she told me she wasn't that type of girl, but I don't think so. She was ready to block me forever just for thinking she might be interested in that kind of thing with someone. She was truly mad, and that's the only time I've ever seen her like that. It seems to me that she thinks sex and validation from guys is gonna make her happy but it's not. All it's gonna do is hurt her in the long run.

202517,"my close friend killed himself and i’m lostall I can say is that everything feels like it’s surrounded by darkness now, things always feel off, and I think I’ve permanently lost any feelings of happiness and hope. knowing that the last moments of his life were the worst he’s ever felt just kills me inside. the fact that he was able to go through with this despite his family and friends is heartbreaking. he mattered to me. and I can’t help but to think that this was impulsive as fuck, I just wish I could’ve known that he was getting worse. he’s always felt like this to some degree, and all I ever wanted to do was help him. 
One of my closest friends just killed himself this past October and I have no idea what to do with myself. it’s a complicated situation because he moved around a couple years ago and hasn’t been home since (hospitalized, etc.), yet we still talked over the phone nearly every day from January-July 2018. we told each other everything, and it was nice knowing that we were always there for one another and ready to listen. he was a selfless, kind, funny, amazing guy-but sadly couldn’t find lasting happiness in anything other than drugs after the suicide of his best friend in our hometown two years ago. he never had anything or anyone constant in his life, and I knew this would always be hard on him, so I tried my best to be a rock for him. and he was for me. after his friend passed in 2016, he was sent away twice and didn’t end up coming back until January of 2018, where he went to live with his Dad (Arizona) until the end of his life. but he never wanted to be there. his dad just figured that after everything that happened here in Indiana with his best friend, there was no point of sending him back here (and he was 17 by this time and still had no say). But despite his age, he always knew that Indiana was his home.
Even with him living all the way out in Arizona this past year, I still made an effort to stay in contact with him daily. we got closer than ever, and even ended up admitting feelings for one another later into our friendship. however, we knew it would have to be long distance until we became adults and he could move back home, so we decided to carry out our friendship with an open mind towards the future. (not to say it wasn’t possible, just that we didn’t want to hold back from any other realistic opportunities as well.) furthermore, he was supposed to come back down to Indiana this summer to visit, but he just got into a new relationship in about June and decided to stay in Arizona for the Summer because of it. completely understandable. he seemed happy, and that’s all I ever wanted. after he started dating his gf,  we still talked regularly for some time. but after it being about about 3 months or so into their relationship, I figured I should probably let him do his own thing. I don’t think he ever saw the problem with talking to me, but I didn’t want to cause any trouble for him with his girlfriend when things finally seemed so good for him. all throughout us talking daily for nearly 8 months he seemed to be doing better-only smoking cigs, weed, and occasionally tripping (much better than his previous drug history) and the new relationship was confirmation that he was finally making sense of his once chaotic life. at one point in June I asked him straight up if he ever felt suicidal anymore, and he said that it was no where near what he used to feel. I guess by this point, I assumed he was finally gaining constant things in his life and people who could bring him natural positivity and happiness. however, 2 and a half months after we stopped talking regularly, he ended his life. 
he and his girlfriend had broken up probably two weeks before he did it, I know that he removed her on every social media, but I’m honestly still not sure what happened between them. I don’t think the end of the relationship directly caused it, but I definitely think that it may have contributed. I also found out from my brother that he started to pick up coke and other drugs after we stopped talking regularly as well. I just feel fucking retarded now. I should have said something. I knew that things were changing towards September but even after I found out he and his girlfriend broke up, I thought I should still wait a bit to spark things back up. my initial plan was to reach out to him on his 18th birthday, because I knew it was a big deal. it would be a huge milestone for him. I can confidently say that he has lived an extremely hard life, and if he could have finally had his own freedom, maybe something could have been different. 
the morning after it happened and the moment I found out was surreal. I woke up to a call from my brother telling me to look at his Facebook. it was one of the worst feelings i’ve ever felt. it honestly took a while for him to even convince me that it’s true. it was a fucked up situation that only got shittier, because being 17 at the time, I wasn’t even able to go to his services or wake because it was too far and intervened with school. it killed me. I felt that I couldn’t be there for him when he really needed it, and now I couldn’t even go to his wake. I feel indefinitely terrible about the whole situation, and this is all I ever think about. if this is all that is going to be on my mind, I just don’t think I see the point. it’s too much to handle. I’ve been trying to for 3 months now, but every second just feels like I found out 5 minutes ago. he’s been such an important person in my life for a while, and I can’t move on from this. no matter what I do for “help”: therapy, more drugs, etc; nothing will bring him back. what’s the point.
this is honestly way too long of a story to try to explain in one post, and this is probably confusing as fuck, but basically idk what to do with myself. I literally had plans to live with him this year. it feels so damaging to have known so much about someone, and cared for them so deeply, just to have everything disappear in an instant. I wish he could have just waited until he was 18 to see if anything changed. he was only a month away. 
I’m tripping on acid for the first time this week, one of the many things I was supposed to do with him, and I’m worried that I’m going to be thinking of him and feel depressed the whole trip. but at the same time, any drug is better than feeling what I do when I’m sober. my life is one bad trip. i’ve been a weed smoker for a while, but recently I have been getting into drugs more than ever before, and everything has just gotten significantly more fucked up. being newly graduated from HS, everyone is asking me about future plans and what I’m doing myself. I give some bullshit answer, but in reality, even a month from now is unimaginable. I wish I could have just done it before him, i’ve always had thoughts and considered it, but it didn’t start constantly running through my mind until now. 
this is just too heavy on me. I feel myself becoming this weak, easily angered, depressed, hopeless person...and it’s inevitable. I imagine nearly every way to end my life every day now, and I’m just tired. my heart hurts. I miss you, and I’m so fucking sorry. you know I always loved you",suicide

202542,"I Just Don’t Know What To Do and I Need to Talk to Someone, AnyoneThis is going to be quite long and somewhat disturbing, I apologise, but years of meds and therapy haven't done it for me so I guess it’s coming off my chest now in my desperation. I have been suicidal since the age of 10. I’ve attempted it several times but I must have the shittiest luck of any miserable human as every single time I have either been stopped by someone or something absolutely absurd happens (when I was 15, I tried to run my car in the garage but it just so happened to run out of gas; I tried to hang myself 2 years later and it ended in embarrassingly abject failure because I’m a useless idiot when it comes to knots I guess). 

I grew up in a very abusive biological family. My father molested me several times throughout my childhood, and both him and my mother threw chairs and glass and plates at me and beat the ever loving shit out of me. I was kept from having relationships and was basically raised in a bubble away from society. I told my mother what my dad did and she told me I was a “lying whore” and refused to believe her husband could do such a thing. Long story short I got the hell out of there as soon as I could and found a new adoptive family and a loving relationship that I believed was filled with support. Years of social isolation and maladjustment imposed upon me by those parents fucked with me so much that other women would bully me and isolate me even further in college. I pursued a military career ( it you can guess how far that goes when you’re suicidal) and later an art career, but some young women I caught the jealous ire of stole my work and basically tortured me into avoiding the programs I needed to be in, delaying my graduation by 2 whole years. They spread nasty sexual rumours about me and made me into some sort of monster to potential friends and any faculty that could offer me support. I go to a very small college in a very small town, so all these things had far reaching effects to even my ability to gain employment in my surrounding area. The one job I did have ended in me getting sexually assaulted by a customer and my employers doing nothing about it. I tried to jump out of a hotel window at the worst of it but my partner stopped me and told me if I ever attempted suicide again they would leave me. I got a little bit better with help and support like you’re supposed to seek out, then it all came plummeting down again.

My adoptive mother passed away a year ago. I haven’t heard from my adoptive father since, and I was kept in the dark on how she died. There was no funeral to my knowledge, and I have no idea what happened to her remains.  No one told me. I found out through an email from a colleague. my father refuses to speak to me. I know he must be grieving harder than I am but it doesn’t change the fact that I feel alone and lost and miserable. I waited so excitedly for all the adult milestones I would share with them—my graduation, my wedding, my children—but now all of that has just faded into impossibility. My biological family has done something similar—like a movie, they’ve tried to erase my presence from their lives and home. Extended family have told me that they scratched my face out of photos and thrown or burned all my old possessions. I find out about deaths in my biological family from one or two people who extend no support other than keeping me in the loop.

A year later and I’m still not in contact with him and I’m still deeply suicidal. I’m terrified of attempting again because my partner is all I have left (please do not shit on them for saying they would leave me; I’ve put them through hell with my depression and their reasoning is very personal and valid and I don’t judge them) and I don’t want to fail and be left alone. I dont have a garage where I live now, and they have taken all the razors and bleach and pills and pretty much anything I could hang myself with out of the house. They monitor how I take my meds and keep them on them for fear I might OD while they’re at work. They care for me and love me deeply, and I them, but I feel shitty and ugly and ungrateful because it doesn’t heal the deep hole that is left in my heart and psyche. I feel stuck in an endless loop, where I just want to kill myself more than anything but literally can’t. My few friends arent depressed and when I bring my feelings to them, they act as though it’s a burden or they tell me they don’t understand and that I “just need love” or “just have to smile more.” 

I have no way out and nowhere to go and no one to be honest with emotionally and it’s crippling me beyond function. All I can do is bash my head against the wall or door and cry when I’m alone. I think the only way I can end it all now is jumping out the window of my apartment, but I know that’s not guaranteed to be successful because I’m not up high enough.

I’m alone and tired of screaming into the ether. I just want to feel heard, and I just need someone to please please acknowledge that all this happened because I’m at a complete loss.

We came up with experiments last year, before COVID, and put our ideas on the back burner for this year. So now we have to do our experiments in the pandemic, which makes it more complicated. I have limited access to supplies so I already had to change my research question. Last week I was in school so I got to collect my data but I have anxiety so it was really nerve-racking. I had to go around to different spots to set up cause 2 teachers got annoyed with me like I'm in school this is for a class where do you want me to do this? But I realized a little more than half way through...that I should've done more than 1 trial! Ugh! I wasn't sure what to do cause I thought people would look at me funny if I said I needed to redo it cause I made that dumb mistake. And I don't know some of the people who participated, they were just random people who were wandering in the hallway during a free. So like I would have to find a few new people and I didn't know where and I only had enough consent forms for my 10 subjects so I'd somehow need to print more. So...I just kept going, figuring it'd be ok. But the more I think about it I know it's going to look really bad if I only have one trial. This is supposed to be a complex project...and now I have no way of collecting data in person cause idk 10 people I can meet up with irl and school's closed again and won't open before the data's due. So I'll have to message her 2 days before the data's due to explain this stupid mistake and then video chat with 10 people, and they all need a tennis ball for the experiment. The good news is I'm in a huge gc with like 30 people and we have a discord server so enough people should be comfortable with video chatting me, I just need to make sure they have the tennis ball and a smooth wall...ughhh I hate anxiety sometimes it's so simple but I go and overthink",non-suicide

Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

That means stuff like cancelling all my subscriptions so they don't have to, return my books to the library, donating my clothes beforehand, etc etc. My question is pretty simple, what are some things that is a pain to deal with for my relatives when I have passed away that i can make easier for them? I've already figured out a lot of things but I'd appreciate it if any of you guys has some advice about general stuff that I can do beforehand. Also, this is NOT a ""I might be killing myself try to stop me"" type of deal, I know that I'm taking the ""cowardly"" way out, and I would rather not discuss that with you guys, so if you could please respect that I would be glad. If you don't have any advice and want to slander me for doing the ""wrong thing"", please do not comment. Thank you

I dont have a lot of good memories to begin with or most of the bad ones just outweighs the good to the point I cant even remember the good ones anymore. My childhood wasn't so great my parents were really abusive to me at the time but in my mind n how i was taught, i cant tell anyone about it. in elementary, I wasn't really smart too n when I get the answers wrong in addition n subtraction with time, or multiplication n division, my parents beat me for not understanding it n it makes me have to learn everything by myself n cant really on anyone for help, no matter how much I needed it. I also get bullied a lot, hardly got any friends, n teachers don't do shit except giving me detention, suspend me, n put me in special ed bcuz i guess at the time, they were being racist to asians. im not sure but im kind of like the only asian in that school. n my parents didnt do shit either. they just beat me for being in trouble when im the one being bullied. middle school, my cousin was kind of popular at the time, he basically pushed me away cuz i guess im a loser. one time a kid stabbed me in the back with a wooden pencil n as i was lying on the ground bleeding, everyone just walked over me. nobody helped me, not even the teachers n i was late for class cuz i was busy being hurt. nurse teacher looked at my back n just gave me a bandage. didnt even put it on for me. so i had to go to the bathroom n there is still a piece of lead stuck in my back. i literally had to dig it out of my back myself. high school i had to pretend to be someone that im not to make friends. i did at first, but i was hang with a bad crowd. at the time during my freshmen year too, i was bullied n i almost died when i was pushed down right at the street. my anger went so bad, i put the guy who bullied me in the hospital due to self defense but i was severely pissed. luckily i got away with it somehow. during 10th grade, 1 friend of mine who i thought was like a bro to me, i let him borrow my bike so he can get home, n i realized he moved away a day after. my parents beat me up for it. then they realize the school is a bad influence due to gang related students there, they moved me to a different school where there r also gang related kids there. i befriended this one person but in his group, 1 guy doesnt like me where he spread rumors of me being a pedo n a faggot bcuz he saw me going to tutoring n talking to kids. the place i get tutored at is all grades. so the guy i befriended hates me bcuz he believed the guy n 1 day when we ran a mile, he tried to push me down the bleachers. i couldve got seriously injured. n ever since the guy who spread rumors about me starts bullying me. this is where i had trouble trusting people n becoming more anti social n the people who were trying to be nice to me, i pushed them away bcuz i cant tell anymore. a year later, 1 day during PE, my team were going against the team where my bully is at n hes been wanting to fight me. i told my PE i dont feel like playing n i told her the reason. she made me play anyways. n i knew from the very beginning, he punched me in the face out of nowhere. i got so much rage in me, i charged right to him. n thats the thing about teacher. they dont give a shit if students were being bullied. u tell on the teacher they dont do shit really, n i learned that since elementary so i have to learn how to defend myself at the case. i got suspended for 3 days n my parents punished me for defending myself. n the thing about my parents is that they only care about me doing well in school. what ive been feeling, how much pain i go through, theyre never been aware of it. during college, it got better for me. i made great friends where i can finally get to be myself for once even when im still confused about who i wanted to be. but my parents has been still giving me shit. the one time i finally make friends, they try to rip that away from me. one time i asked my mom for help, which is finding my bank account number cuz idk how bank account works at the time, she took advantage n look through my statements n judge in front of me how much i was spending. i was 22 at the time n she has no rights to go snoop around my statement. i asked her for help to find my number, not look through my statements. i couldnt trust her for anything anymore cuz i did caught her in the past trying to steal a bit of money away from me n throwing away my clothes when i am still wearing them n she still does it. my dad wasnt being so great with me either cuz he left me out in the open 3-5 times as a kid by myself while he was busying gambling his money away. n when i was around 20 years old, we got into an argument n he straight up told me that he wished he n my mom couldve aborted me when he had the chance. it broke me to the point that i felt like a disappointment, a mistake, n it lead me to wanting to commit suicide. i scratched my arms with a box knife after that too. n i gave away my happiness for my friends so they can be happy but it doesnt make me happy cuz i felt like theres no point for me since my life is meaningless. it is really pathetic that my relationship with my parents keeps going on n off bcuz they never learned from their mistakes. almost felt like my mom wants me to do what she wants me to do but it is something that i dont want to do. she wants me to have a future that she wanted for me but i want to make the choices that is best for me. as for my dad, i felt like he wanted to get rid of me for a long time but couldnt bcuz he doesnt want to make himself look bad, so he tortured himself to live up with for years, trying to be my dad, but i felt like he was only faking it. i took a photography job for 2 years n i enjoyed photography. but i have to sell up a number or more per shift due to the fact its commission base. theres been too many issues with 2 bosses to the point i saw like 40 employees come n go n i got a bit attached. then some other people who work there gave me a hard time as well n i cant say anything bcuz my boss will make up excuses n tell me to keep working. selling pictures was really hard cuz not a lot of people want pictures, n for the fact we have smartphones these days, but my boss said everybody always spend money here bcuz we work at an amusement park. i use to sell a lot of pictures back then but now i cant bcuz this season, nothing special is happening, n my boss told me to ask customers again after they said no, which is out of my beliefs cuz no means no n thats the customers rights. its wrong to try to be pushy. he also tells me to ""bring back the old u"" meaning i sold a lot of pictures back in the past n now he wants me to bring that person back. i feel like its the shittest thing to say to anyone. 2 years passed n it just got worse for me, my plan was to find a new job n quit, but the manager pushed me to the edge to the point that i had enough. i quit immediately. my friends think i did the right thing but my parents judged me for it n shitted on me like i just committed a murder. at the same time, they got mad at me for skipping one year of college, which isnt a bad thing cuz i graduated community college with aa degrees of liberal arts n psychology. been in community college for 4-5 years to the point i need a break. plus i couldnt afford to pay for classes in csuf at the time so i didnt have much of a choice but to skip at least a semester. however i skipped a year bcuz i didnt attend my first semester during the fall so i have to reapply all over again n idk if ill be lucky the second time to get accepted. my parents got mad at me, making me feel more of a disappointment, n my dad wants to kick me out. my situation with my job n my dad wanted to kick me out is recent. this had lead me to even a darker place where i actually wanted to end my life cuz its not fair. i never asked for any of this. to be born. to live. to breath. none of it. my family was always so negative to each other for god knows how long they live in america to the point its affecting me too. always comparing me to others who seemed smarter or better than me, then why let me live? why cant they just make a different child n just kill me? i dont know what to do anymore. i know that everyone had issues that r worse than mine, like parents abandoning their children, being homeless, or poor n starving n all, but im not like anyone else who can handle it better than i can. im different. everyone is. no matter what people say to me to cheer me up, its never gonna make me feel any less than an outcast or failure in life. I’m turning 24 right now but I feel everybody has more responsibility than I did at this age n they’ve done better with their lives than I do. Having a life, getting married, feeling happy with love ones truly, that is something I will never gonna get bcuz i felt like a huge burden to everyone i knew n that I’m a waste of air who should go die. maybe its best for everyone if i just never exist at all anymore. im sorry that i made u all read all this.",suicide
202607,"its happening againMy last post talked about my cycle of depression and how it never got to suicide until then. My cycle also goes from at least a year or two. This is the quickest it came back and it hit harder then before. Before it was just an urge, like an ich you know you are not supposed to scratch. This time its much worse. No one will believe me, but its a voice this time, horrible. Every time I hear it I feel more and more hollow. There are also images I'm imagining, me on the floor bleeding out, me stung up by a rope. Last time I could almost escape by doing the things I love to do; play video games, talk to my girlfriend or wight a few poems or a short story. But now everything seems tedious and unimportant, not to mention I haven't even talk to me GF in over 2 weeks. The only thing that makes me feel even a little bit alive is putting a blade to my wrist and feeling the pulse of my vein struggle against it. I feel like there is nothing left for me to be strong about and all that's left is weakness. I don't think I have the strength to stop my self next time I try. The only thing really stopping me this time is I haven't picked a method of death yet; bleed, strangle, snap or OD",suicide

202631,"I don't know where to go from here anymoreI feel absolutely worthless, hopeless and totally in despair. This is going to be a fairly long post so I apologize in advance.

I'm a 23 male. I have body dismophia and anxiety for starters. I'm often told I'm a good looking guy and on the rare occasion I almost believe it myself but a lot of the time I find some flaw that I hate with myself. I keep myself groomed, I workout and can see I'm in good shape, better shape than most guys actually yet I still dislike the way I look a lot of the time. The anxiety affects also in so many ways, the biggest is that I haven't had a proper girlfriend minus one girl who I didn't even kiss at 15. The sad thing is I still care about her even now. I'm not even sure how I'm ever going to date, I never get close enough to any girl and any I feel like like me I get too anxious to do anything about it or approach them.

The worst is that I try soooo hard and yet things keep getting worse. I went to college when I was 16 - 19 and got 2 out of 3 A levels I needed because of all the issues I was having, I went back to college a year ago to finish that last one so I can maybe go to University in a year. Going back hasn't made me feel good infact I've hated it, I've been stuck in a class of 16 year olds who I barely talk to and have no friends there. Although I have the ambition to work soon I haven't been able to work for the last 3 years which makes me awful, like scum and that everyone thinks badly of me of it.

It's not like I don't do anything, I do go to the gym a lot and have trained in Martial Arts for a long time which I still do and I have made a lot of effort to meet up with people and go to different meet ups to mix but I still don't really have any friends, I just have a number of acquaintances who I see within their contexts (like the martial arts for example) but it's not like having proper friends.

I feel like I've missed out on so much and that just makes me feel so suicidal, although I've been to bars before and a couple of hourse parties I've never gone to nightclub, I've never really dated or done the things that come along with that, haven't worked as much as I'd have liked and haven't been to university. The worst thing is I feel like at 23 I must be too old or will be seen as too old to doa lot of the things I feel like I've missed although I feel really young, infact I feel no different physically or mentally than when I wss 17 or 18, don't really look any older either. I just feel like it's too late now, too late to try and date now as a women will think I'm weird for not dating, too late to go to university as they'll all be (by the time I go) 5-6 years younger and I won't fit in.

Sorry for my post being all over the place, I haven't been very clear and to be honest I'm not sure I can be, my mind is all over the place and I feel so suicidal I'm not even sure what to do with myself.

Been applying for a year and a bit and still no luck, even though I have no real desire of getting a job or doing anything. Most people my age already have their life set out and planned, with goals and ambitions. Unfortunately for me I don’t have any, nothing that drives me. People say do what you enjoy doing, and the things I enjoy doing are literally: sleeping, getting high, and playing games. 

I do make money on the side by working in property, doing surveys and floor plans, but recently that’s been drying up and I’ve been ignoring calls for business. I’ve even lost the drive to make money for myself. 

I had a car crash on the motorway a few months ago pretty bad one, hit the barriers at 90-95 mph an hour and some how survived. I sit here now wishing I died in that crash. I took a baseball bat to head when I was 17 also survived that, didn’t even get knocked out. Hell I even survived getting Typhoid as a kid. I used to think that surviving this shit was meant to mean something, but that all bullshit and was down to luck.

Anyways long story short, I’ve been wanting to kill my self since like 16. I have no dreams of having a family, job or whatever these successful people have. I rather have not existed in the first place. I’ve never done anything of merit or good that stands out. And I don’t plan on doing anything like that in the future.

Money , trips to the caribbean sea, endless stream of love and support from my family and Friends, a life of doing nothing but smoking weed and playing videogames while living at mom's. I don't feel thankful even if I should. I can't come through with anything I want to do. I can't socialize properly. I play videogames all day long and still suck at them. I can't do sports. I dropped out of highschool. I NEVER got special attention from a girl in my life, actually I did once, but I ran off to tell everyone that I was with her and when she confronted me I instantly replied with "" go fuck yourself"". My father loves me a lot and I left him because mom lets me smoke pot. I now only visit him when I need money for weed or another material. My mom is depressed and she has to put up with me and my stoner Friends everyday feeding every one of them. I didnt attend my father's grandma last birthday before she died. In fact I NEVER attend anyone's birthday but I feel angry of they don't attend mine. I always call black people thieves or drug addicts. Asians I call adicted gamers or ninjas. I discriminate everyone I can't relate with. I am ugly.  Socially awkward. I offend people who haven't wronged me ever. I talk shit about everyone behind their backs. I want to kill someone one day just to feel taking someone's life and letting all my anger out. I make myself busy to my only real Friends just to not share them my weed. I tried to fuck my dog. I broke people's hearts many times. I don't trust anyone. I always disturb everyone's plans with my problems. I am literally a waste of space food love trust hope and money. Always try to convince myself that I am not this way or that I didnt do such bad things but when life tests me I always fail and prove once more that I am and I did everything that I just said. I tried to rejoin highschool three times and dropped out every time. I tried to improve my physical condition and I gave up every time. I tried to correct myself as a person but once I stop feeling like a piece of shit I start being one at them same time. I can't change what I am. I am shit. I don't want to die but I want all of this self pitying and lying to stop. I want everyone to stop caring for me because I don't deserve it. I can't even charm a girl, so I can't procreate therefore I can't even do the human basic function. I am a horrible person. I fail at everything I try. I can't ever change that. I should had been dead a long while ago. I NEVER deserved life. I was always a dumb, clunky, ugly, fat, selfish, superiorist dogfucker. I don't want to die because I am a pussy.

I hated retail. I hated everything about it. I left that job and started working at a Tim Hortons and a bar. I was happier busting my butt at two jobs than working as a fucking cashier. 

Its several year later and my degree is basically pointless because of the virus. I applied to everywhere around me and the only place that would hire me is a dollar general. I'm fucking miserable. I think about killing myself constantly. I think about just falling backwards off a ladder and busting my head open. I think about jumping in front of a train before I get there.

202681,Just writing some of my thoughts outI’m still suicidal but kinda on the fence if I can actually build up the courage to do it. I want this pain to end but I’m afraid to do it myself. I know A part of me wants to live but the other part wonders if it’s worth it. I’ve been sick to my stomach lately and not sure if it’s the depression or anxiety or both. My chest always feels faint and I have no energy. Early this morning I went to the ER to get staples put in for more self harm. I was sent home after the staples were put in. I’m starting to wonder if I’m safe to be on my own right now or do I need to be in hospital. I haven’t been admitted on a psych unit in about a year. I feel like I’m at the end of my being and nothing is left of the person I was. I see my family doctor tomorrow and hopefully get a medical not to quit my job (a lot of people don’t agree that I should do that but I just can’t do it). I want to get better and I don’t think I can adjust my meds anymore I basically just have to wait whatever this is out. What is one supposed to do when they have come to nothing left inside and have a death wish. My self harm is “non suicidal” but is problematic enough that it could “accidentally” lead to death and I don’t think I’d care if it did.

But after quite a while of reading posts, I realised that I'm in no position to help despite how much I really want to. I don't really know how, and that hurts because I really want to help. So I suppose I've resorted to making my own post now.

I don't want to die at all, you see. I want to live a happy life, see things, discover things, love things, hear things. I want to enjoy the summer and build snowmen in winter. But I feel like I have no choice anymore, because there is no happiness for me and I can't do those things.

I'm 23, and I have a disability which makes it almost impossible for me to walk. I can very short distances - perhaps down the stairs to the den, or to the bathroom - with aids such as a prop (I hate saying stick) and holding onto walls, but then I absolutely have to stop. I usually just use the walls. 

I can't even use a motorized wheelchair or scooter, because my disability affects my co-ordination and eyesight.. and over stimulation of the senses can set my body off haywire too, and make me very ill with a chance of landing me in hospital. So even if I had someone to push a chair for me.. which I don't.. I would still be stuck in this house, this room. I have been for years now, since my health degraded as a teen.

The doctors can't help, they say it seems incurable. They say it seems like a mix of things. They can see the affects on my body with tests, but they dont see the root of how or why. They're sympathetic, but after looking at me for 7 years, they can't help.

I hate seeing 'what about the people who love you?!' as a reason to live, because I have none. I get so frustrated when I see people say that.. even if its not directed at me.. it's like rubbing it in my face. Is it so hard for people to see that some of us have no one? When we say we have no friends, we literally mean we have none and don't talk to anyone all day? No one who cares? Family who doesnt bother, family that may even resent? When I see that 'reason to live', it makes me feel like theres another reason not to.. because I don't have anyone. No one would miss me. My mother acts as a carer and is the only person who would even noticed if I were gone, but if it werent for the fact that 'caring' for me so helps her further her political career, I would be out of luck. She's very much resents me, but uses me as a tool, to get votes. I've been in the papers against my wishes a few times because of this. Furthering her cause. Her lying about what she 'does for me'. I hate it. I'm currently sitting in a bed that hasnt been changed for 5 months, covered with rubbish, in a room filled with cobwebs. She doesnt let anyone in here. If the papers come, I'm ushered downstairs and my illness glamorised for her.

I do go on, don't I.. My point is, I can't enjoy the summer, or build snowmen. I can't see anything outside of these walls. I have no one. I'm not loved, and I have no one who wants my love either. I don't want to die, but I see no choice when the possibility of being happy is impossible for me. Because I'm here, and this is it.

I tried to make friends online. Every time, I'm just used. They start off sympathetic about my illness, then it always seems to turn into some morbid reason to use me.. because they know I'm isolated, they know I'm not going anywhere, so I'm just used until they have no use for me. Because I'm just broken worthlessness to them.

So many times that has happened. Used for advice, used for flirting, used for entertainment. All online. That trusty, faceless, online 'friend'. I cannot even see the possibility of meeting anyone who actually likes me, and who I actually can like and trust back, anymore. I just feel so exhausted and done. 

I don't even want to talk to anyone anymore, it feels like so much work just to be used and forgotten.

I did fall in love once. He used to visit me. I miss him with every part of me. It's been a very long time. I still dream about him at night when I dont want to. I can't even begin to describe how much I loved him.

Sometimes I imagine my last stand.. I'd make my way (albeit slowly) to a high bridge, just around the corner from me, that's over a river. And that would be it. The pain and the isolation, all over. All of this. It seems like the only choice.

And that's me.",suicide
202693,"i genuinely deserve to die a horrible deathwhen i was 14 i was talking to a friend about this person who had a crush on my best friend, my friend brought up the fact that this person was sexually abused by their uncle. then i went into a panic attack and vented to my friend about all these “memories” that were popping up. “memories” of being fingered when i was young, being shown porn at a young age, and having my chest played with by my own uncle.

then after that i spiraled and was convinced my uncle molested me, i told around 5 people. it was a terrifying thing. then shortly after, i had a nightmare of the exact “memory” that appeared during the time i had a panic attack. after that nightmare i was fucked up, i didn’t sleep for 4 days, was having constant panic attacks, smoked a lot of weed, and self harmed. i was convinced i was molested. 

then i got sent to the ER because my anxiety and fatigue was driving me insane and suicidal. i spent 3 days in their ER then went to a mental hospital. 

i was talking to a lady there about why i was so fucked up and i remember explaining that i was molested and was also sexually assaulted by one of my friends(which i know for a fact did happen no questions asked). 

then after i was discharged from the mental hospital cps made me file a police report. i told the investigator my “memories” of being molested, and also told her about my sexual assault story.

now around 5 months later, i feel extreme guilt. my uncle was never convicted for any crimes and neither was the guy who did assault me.

why do i feel guilty? because i lied. at that time those “memories” felt real but now when i think about it, it’s bullshit. and i deserve to die for it. i deserve to die for nearly ruining an innocent man’s life. 

now before you tell me what i know your thinking i’ll just say it myself: i deserve to die. i deserve to kill my self. i’m a waste of space. i fucked up big time. i should kill myself. i should slit my wrists. i am a nightmare. i’m a piece of shit. i’m a liar. i’m scum.

202717,"It's been months and I still can't get over this traumaBefore I start this: I've had serious mental health issues for 3 years. I have depression, anxiety and OCD. I started college when I was 17 and all I wanted to do was make friends, because I hadn't had any for years. So I made friends with these 4 girls in first year. They were all pretty dodgy. They could be really mean, just straight up do bad things, hang out with bad people - but I stayed friends with them because we got along and I got value out of people liking me. So I'll start with this in mind.


I'm a 19 year old girl. I was in second year of college this year and the last semester was the worst time of my life. It's been months and I'm trying so hard but every single day its all i think about.

I broke up with my emotionally manipulative boyfriend in February this year, and that's where it all started. I lived with my four 'friends' last year, and they were they reason for all this trauma. I took the break up really badly because I had never confronted all the horrible things he did to me until I finally decided to break up with him. So, I wanted to talk to my friends about it, because I had never told anyone before. And I assumed that they would understand, because I have spent hours upon hours with two of them talking about their exes when they were going through breakups. One friend only went out with a guy for a week and I spent the whole previous semester talking to her about him because she wouldn't get over him. However, whenever I brought up my ex or anything he did to me, I was met with silence, they wouldn't even look at me. Eventually after 3/4 weeks they told me to just stop talking about him and to move on. They said that I had completely changed ever since breaking up with him, that I used to be really kind and nice the whole time and now all I did was complain about my life and I need to get over it. I just said okay and that I would try to improve. 

For the next 2 months, up until college ended, I never brought him up again. But for some reason, they just all started to talk about me behind my back and gang up on me and give out to me for loads of things, even though I never did anything to them, or did anything wrong in general. Literally every single day I would come home to them and they would find something to give out to me about, even something as stupid as the fact my room wasn't clean. Even at one point one of the girls said that she was being too hard on me, and that the other girls were always finding something to complain about to do with me. But I never stood up to them because this was the first time in years I had friends and all I wanted was to keep that friendship, even though they absolutely were not my friends. 

Now, it wasn't just this. Two of my friends were still friends with my ex, and ever since I broke up with him they were hanging out with him a lot more. I found out that the girls had been telling him that I was ""bitching about him"" the whole time and saying that I hated him and that he was really bad to me. Somehow, through this, I turned out to be the bad one and he turned out to be the good one, the victim in all of this. I also found out that they were telling him really private information, like about a guy that I started to like. 

To segue from that. I started a new job and started to like a guy there. He was really kind and funny to me and I got along with him well. But, even though the girls had never met him, they just started to really maliciously mock me over liking him. They were saying that he sounded stupid and were looking him up online and laughing at his profile and never listened to me when I said he was actually really nice. 

But it turned out he wasn't really nice. He started to do really mean and malicious things to me. He would invite me on a night out and then ignore me for the whole night. One time he grabbed me and kissed me really hard and then said 'now go away'. Then after about 3 weeks another new girl started at work, and he started to say things to her in front of me like 'you're my favourite co worker', which he said to me before he got with me. 

Then it got worse. One day I looked at his insta profile and saw a few pictures of him from 2 years ago with this girl I knew. I asked him how he knew her and he didn't answer, he just said he hated her. So I messaged her asking how they knew each other, and she said that they were friends for a few months, but one night he got her really drunk at his house and sexually assaulted her. I met up with her to talk about it and she wasn't faking. It freaked me out because he used to say to me that he would never have sex with me if I was drunk, and then would buy me loads of drinks on a night out and bring me back to his place and have sex with me. I didn't think anything of it but I regretted it so much. 

I told 3 of the girls what happened, and they just didn't react - they were acting in a kind of 'I told you so' way, when they had never even met him. Later on, I was about to tell the other girl and before I could say anything she just said 'Yeah [anon] told me', and that was it - we never talked about it again.

Before you say anything, I know - it was stupid for me to not do anything when he was being an asshole to me. It's just the fact that I was finding solace in this guy when I had none, and was really trying to rationalise the whole thing. After all of this I'm never staying with a guy who has any traits like that, because that's the third guy in my life I've been fooled by and I know what the signs are by now.

The second last thing: one of the things my ex used to be really emotionally abusive over was to do with these friends that I had. He would smack their asses or even bite them sometimes and the two times I pulled him over it he made me feel really bad about it, saying I was a controlling girlfriend. However, the worst was to do with one of them in particular, I'll call her J. He was kind of obsessed with J. My relationship with him was really intense in the sense that he would say that he was completely in love with me and he wanted to spend his life with me - but he would also say things like 'J is still the best girl' and 'I 95% love you and 5% love J', among many other things. They were never close when we were together, and they weren't friends after we broke up either.

However, one day, about 2 weeks before college ended, I finally decided to tell her about this. When I told her, she didn't console me, or say that was awful, or be a friend in any capacity. Instead, she went to a party he was holding in his that weekend, went up to him, and started talking to him about me and flirting with him. I know this, because he was the one who maliciously told me when I met him one day. 

I was really mad, so I told the other girls what happened. They laughed, and said 'Well, that's just J'. They then told J that I was ""bitching about her"" behind her back. Again, I valued that 'friendship' up until the very end, and I stupidly apologised to her for talking about her. 

This is the final part. A day before moving out, I started to have a panic attack in my room. I was having panic attacks pretty much every day at this point, but I had never asked anyone for help - I just stayed in my room and never told anyone. But this one was a major one - something started happening to me that had never happened before, and it was terrifying because I didn't know it could happen. I lost feeling and movement in my hands - it was because my heart was beating so fast. They curled up and I couldn't move or feel them, it was terrifying. 3 of my friends were at work, so I called the one who was at home. At this point it really seemed like she didn't like me - again, I had never done anything wrong to her. So, she walked into my room, and I was on my bed. I was balling crying and hyperventilating and I told her that I didn't know whether or not I needed to go to the hospital. But she was just looking at me as if I was doing something wrong. She was just standing at the other side of the room without a wrinkle of concern on her face. She asked me 'What do you want me to do', and that was pretty much it - after a minute she just left, and I went into the shower in the bathroom and tried to take deep breaths.

This was the breaking point to me, and I finally stood up to her. I confronted her about it in front of the other girls and all of a sudden, she took this victim stance, saying that she was helping me and I was such a bitch. All the girls ganged up on me, said I was a freak, to go to hell, to go fuck myself and that I was crazy.

The next day when I was moving out of the house, my mom and sister were helping me bring my stuff down from my room. At this point, I hadn't spoken to the girls since that final event happened. But when I was coming up the stairs with my mom and sister, I could hear them laughing in the room opposite to mine. We got upstairs to my room and they had the opposite door open. They started saying Hi to my mom and sister, and my mom and sister said hi back, because they didn't know that I had fallen out with them. They just started laughing at me right in front of them and I couldn't do or say anything back. They started to do loads of humiliating things like pretending to chug vodka in front of my mom and sister, it was just so needless and malicious and it was all because I stood up to one of them for not helping me during a panic attack. When we had all of my things together I left and never saw them again. 

I was friends with them for almost two years and did so much for them. I never did anything wrong to them and was always there for them when they were down. I even got them a house for the summer, and got one of them her first job for the summer, because they wanted to stay up near college and not go home for the summer. But they just all turned on me and it's been 3 months  and I still think about it every day. 

But its not just the events that I think about - the main thing is the fact that I never stood up to them for anything. Theres so many things I wish I could have said to them that they'll never know now. Like I know they're all shitty people - before they all decided to gang up on me, they used to always talk about each other behind their backs the whole time, and they're involved with this group of guys where I met my ex, who are all college dropout drug addicts who are blatantly shit and unkind people. But I never got to stand up to them about any of that. I just valued that 'friendship' until the very end. And I've definitely learned that I should never do that again - but the fact that they got away with everything just haunts me every day. 

I'm lucky to have a good friend who I met from one of my classes in first year, and I've become really close to him over summer - he's introduced me to his really nice group of friends who are all good people and he said that next year I can hang out with them the whole time, so I'm so delighted about that. I've started doing mindfulness, yoga and running since the start of the summer which has been really confidence boosting and mood lifting too. But I'm just afraid I'll never get over this because no matter all this stuff, it's in my head every minute of every day.

Any advice?

Thank you so much guys. Much love. &lt;3 xx",suicide
202718,"It just hurts too much anymore.I have struggled with depression and anxiety in the past but have had it under control for many years until now. 


In the past few weeks so many things have happened in my life and compiled to where I feel so hopeless and like a complete failure. I just don’t see the point anymore. 


I am a 26 year old woman and married to my high school sweetheart. 


I spent 2 years after already getting a degree going back to school again full-time quitting my job to start a new career which still hasn’t happened because my health has taken over my life and I’m unable to work so my time is spent between doctors appointments and physical therapy trying to fix me.


We are living with my dad because we were trying to buy a house which is no now longer an option the area we live in is just out of control competitive. My
Husband works in Afghanistan and is currently there right now so while he is gone I’ve been searching and applying for rentals that we just keep getting turned down for. Over and over and over again.


My cousin had a baby last week which was amazing and a happy occasion and I spent three days house/dog sitting cleaning and preparing their home for the baby (baby was very early and they were unprepared) and I left feeling why am I not there? Why don’t I have a normal life where I see my husband all the time and live on our own and am having babies? Rather than be happy for them which I feel guilty about even thinking.


Then my husband dropped a massive bomb on me, he has a prom addiction he has been struggling with for YEARS, high school to be specific (when we met) and it explains a lot of our intimacy issues (I can count on my fingers how many times a year we have sex). How do I not feel like he is not attracted to me or that I’m not good enough? How do I not take this personally? 


Well the real kicker was last night. I got in a fight with my dad over something completely pointless and unimportant and he decided to really stick it home how worthless I am by listing every mistake I made is a teenager and telling me I am nothing but a disgrace and a mistake and he is done with me for good and wants me out of his life and out of his house immediately calling me every horrible name in the book and washing his hands of me as a human being. 


My in-laws live two miles from my Dads and are out of town so I packed a bag and am staying here. I haven’t eaten in two days and all I can think is I’m not enough. I’m a burden. I just fail at everything. I’m a failure as a daughter, a wife, a person.  I don’t want to be here anymore and it hurts too much. ",suicide

202722,"Help Me When I hit that RKO on the alligator he flipped me on my back and started to role. I had no idea wtf I was gonna do, so I blasted him back into the pond scum from which he came. I threw my leg into that croco's sternum and he smiled and said, "" do drugs kiddos"" before biting down hard on his own tail. At this point, I was so angry, that I was lactating. With him being forged in the fires of mount clap ass itself, he could death toll me so fucking bad my scapula would tear in two. Basically I just shot the crocodile and I got arrested by fish and wildlife services cause Carole Fuckin Baskin pays those bitches off. 

-

So after I got arrested by fish and wildlife, I slipped one of the guards a fat stack and he let me pass with a warning. I knew I had to claim revenge on El Crocodilo, so I found the biggest fucking magic dragon money could buy, said fuck the lube, and drove on down to the Everglades, also the home of that bitch Carole Baskin. I found him, in all his glory, on the edge of clear water pond. ""Fiddlesticks"", he cried, as he propped up on two legs and ran away. He had become bipedal. I chased after him and leaped into the air, thrusting the magic dragon straight into its miniscus. He roared a mighty roar, as he fell to the ground. I had perfectly skewered the beast, while simultaneously piercing the sun. After twisting that croco's dick tighter to the point of laceration, I carried on to find that his children had just hatched and scurried off into the marsh. I could not let this happen. I must end his bloodline.
The End?

- 

So as I was saying, it was time to annihilate El Crocodilo's bloodline. Like the alligator forged in the fires of mount clapass itself that was currently laying before me, I proceeded to go absolute sicko mode on some fuckin croco's. I turned to midgemong, thinking he would be lubricated axle in between a mexican mans left quadricep easy, however the beast was not easily skewered, as he realeased the primordial ooze from his pouch. After squeezing my double roided triple fist right handed semi sore beating tool tighter than a hydraulic press, I completely obliterated the beast, by dropping 457 lbs of my dead weight onto the animal. My scapula was still torn into the shape of an amsterdam strippers spine, but I had smoten the beast.

- 

So like I was saying I started triple fisting midgemong, El Crocodilo's youngest, and then out of nowhere that fuckin bitch Barole Baskin leaps into the air and starts doing some weird ritualistic dancing shit so I beat the fuck out of her and feed her to senor gomez who just fucking obliterates her almost as bad as those tigers obliterated her husband. Like I mean HOLY FUCK. My quest to end the bloodline of el crocodilos continued, and it started with his second youngest, Gregorny. I blasted the holy fucking shit out of Gregorny before you know it he started fucking doing this crazy karate clonic and snorting about 35 kilos of ketamine. Now because of the ketamine, he completely ceased to feel pain. He charged at me so I pulled out my .22 plinkster and dumped a mag directly into his left obliquelar. The rounds were completely deflected by by my man Gregorny's strong core, cause hes been an avid subscriber to 6 minute abs. So I shoved my hand up his ass and pupppeted him.

202725,"It’s really sad how lonely being suicidal isLike, you can’t talk to anyone. 

And if you can, it’s like maybe one or two people. Half of them are probably your medical team, who check in with you once or twice a week, and are paid to care about you. 

You know all your “family and friends care” but it’s impossible to talk to them. You don’t want them to overreact. You don’t want them to worry. 

You can’t hang out with your friends anymore because you have nothing positive or noteworthy to say. No one wants to go to dinner or to a bar and hear about how you hate living. You don’t want to bring the mood down all the time. 

And the one person you trust to talk to can’t handle all of your stress. You can’t rely on just that person. It takes a toll on them and stresses them out too, so now you start censoring yourself and feel like you can’t tell them everything. 

And then you’re just stuck with your thoughts in your head. Wondering what’s the best thing to do. 


And then there’s the planning. 

What to write in your note saying goodbye. What to do with your dog. How to leave your apartment. What date to set. 

I just wish euthanasia was legal so I could die with my friends and family by my side. I wish I could talk freely about my thoughts and plans, and have support in my decision. I wish someone could be by my side in my last moments. 

But no, I have to do this alone. And it’s so lonely.

Its gotten hard to enjoy the happy moments because no matter how nice they are I know as soon as that moment ends everything goes back to just an insufferable emptiness.

Its hard to even want to keep going Im 23 now and have been this was for almost two thirds of my life Im exhausted Ive put as much fight as I have in me into this and I know Im about to break. Even my hobbies that I used to love so much dont bring me joy anymore so Ive thrown myself at new one and it works for a few months at best and then that enjoyment dissappears as well.

I cant escape this feeling of loneliness, I spend as much time with with my friends as I can but I dont feel any connection to them anymore. In fact I dont feel a connection to anyone I know when Im gone Ill be a fleeting memory that people will mostly forget soon after.

He supported me, spoke like he truly understood me, listened when I needed to vent about family and friends, and congratulated me on my achievements. He was the only person in my life who I was open to. 

But it was all wrong. He was 25, and I was 14. He would subtly bring sex into the conversation. Like asking about masturbation and porn, and how my body looked. At first I just thought he was asking to get a better understanding of me so to better help me. But no, he seduced (more like emotionally coerced) me into cybersex. 

I kept talking to him for months because he was the only one I could get support from. I’m afraid of people blaming me for talking to him in the first place and continuing with the cybersex, but you need to experience the loneliness, isolation, and depression that I did to understand. 

I’m trying to move on. I’m afraid of him possibly not reacting well with me when I stop responding. I know it’s unlikely he would hurt me in person but I still fear it. That’s why I’ve been screen recording and taking screenshots of evidence and storing it in a flash drive just in case.

I am always in a more clear state of mind the day after.  Ill give you some background first.  I have been depressed for the past 2 years and was just diagnosed by a therapist a month ago because my friends were worried about me and made me go.  I haven't been back since because I am convinced that it only made me worse.  I lost my dad to suicide last year.  My dad was mentally ill and put me through a lot in my lifetime but he was still my best friend.  He was the only person who could make me feel as if I matter.  He was the only person who ever truly understood me.  I was already depressed for a year when he passed away and it only got worse.  I have lived the past year in fear that my life would end up like his and that makes me feel like life is not worth living.  I feel like I am going to end up alone and mentally ill and my anxiety and depression will take me over.  I want to die before it comes to that.  Heres what Ive been struggling with lately:  I have lots of friends who go above and beyond to prove that they love me and care about me but there is something in me that can not accept that anyone truly loves me for who I am.  Its like on a base level, I know that these people love me and care about be but I can not absorb it.  They do so much for me but every time I am extremely suicidal,  I think about them to give me a reason to stay alive but I think about it and begin to feel as if my death would not affect them.  I feel as if I do not matter.  There is one friend in particular who I have talked to about this and Ive called him a few times when I was thinking about suicide but I feel as if Im guilt tripping him and fishing for compliments when Im not.  When I talk to people, Im not asking for them to prove their love for me because I know that it is my own problem.  I hate everything about myself so much that it is impossible for me to believe that anyone likes me or accept any form of love.  I hate how I look, I dont think Im funny,  I constantly feel as if I am a burden, I find myself to be annoying,  I am too quiet,  I am driven by my own anxiety, and I don't look at myself as human,  I feel as if I am a lesser species than any other person.  I know that all of my problems are with myself and no one else can fix them, thats why I feel bad talking to my friends about them.  I feel as if I would be worrying them about something they can not fix and making them feel responsible when I do take my own life.  I am not looking for advice.

202806,"I'm hurting so much.I'm almost 40 and just had my 2nd boyfriend which only lasted 3months. He dumped me yesterday bc I asked him if he ever told his parents that we're now in a serious relationship instead of me being some girl he was sorta seeing. He lashed out at me and cursed me out all day today then made it very clear by repeatedly cursing why tf am I calling him and trying to talk to him, do I understand that we have NO RELATIONSHIP whatsoever? Stop calling him, he doesn't give a shit about me. 

Well, here's my backstory - 9yrs ago, I decided on career change and worked my ass off for 3yrs to get into grad school. I chose the wrong school and faculty hated me so much. 6months before I was set to graduate they kicked me out of the program for no good reason. I had a 3.78 GPA, I was finishing up my clinical rotations, but apparently they never planned on letting me graduate. A VP board member told me that it's common practice at their university for programs to keep students in the program as long as possible to make money off those students when they already know they don't plan on letting certain students they dislike graduate. They get away with it bc it's a religious private institution so they have so many loop holes. When the loopholes don't work, their power attorneys keep extending the trial until they bleed the students dry and former students trying to sue the school can no longer afford to pay attorney fees to continue fighting. I lost 7yrs of my life and came out of that school with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I tried to kill myself 3xs while I was in the program, but each time I was brought back. I spent 2yrs trying to pull myself out of depression and not end my life. Things just barely started to get better this year. Then I got together with my boyfriend and at first it was phenomenal - but that only lasted 3wks. After that he started getting so temperamental with me and would lash out at me when things in his life stressed him out or he was having a bad day. Stupid me kept going back to him bc he'd apologize and give me so many empty promises. The last 2months were so tumultuous and now it's over bc I asked him a question. 

What do I have to live for? I have no support system. I don't really have friends, I don't have a relationship with my family except for my mom and she can be a real bitch. She calls me a loser for being hurt over this. I can't find a job bc I'm not qualified for anything. Companies find it suspicious that I have such a gap in work history, but I can't exactly explain to them that I went for a career change and that failed. That just makes me look even worse. And honestly, I've really wanted to find love more than anything. That's why I kept going back to my ex every time he apologized for lashing out at me or dumping me nearly every weekend. But this time he's done with me for good - which is a good thing bc I was becoming a door mat. I just feel like I don't fit in this world and I don't want to be in it anymore. 40yrs of my life so far have been a lot of tragedies, horrors, and messed up things. What do I have to look forward to? I'm too naive and stupid for this world. I'm not strong enough to continue on. They say you gotta love yourself, but how do you love yourself when no one's shown you what love is? My family never loved me and made it a point to let me know I was a burden to them growing up. I spent so much of my 20s trying to win their love and affection by paying their bills, fixing their credit, and taking care of them. When I fell into debilitating depression, suddenly I was the good for nothing child and loser. They say there's always someone in the world who loves you that you just don't know... I can honestly say, that's not the case with me. All my friends move on wtih their lives. They've all gotten engaged, married, or started a family and don't have time for me. I called the suicide hotline and the lady rushed to get me off the line and only made me want to end my life even more. I feel absolutely hopeless and empty inside. I'm in so much internal pain and heartbreak that I don't want to keep going. How do I stop this? What if the next 40yrs is even worse than my first 40yrs? I can't handle anymore trauma and bad crap. This world wouldn't notice if I was gone. I can't stop crying and wondering why I'm such a f\*\*\*ing loser.",suicide

202814,"I finally understand you allSo many of the posts here are people saying their last goodbyes. Talking about how nothing can ever get better and they’re giving up.

When I first joined I wasn’t sure how to feel about it. On one hand I understood but on the other I wanted to convince everyone who wrote those posts that things DO get better.

I attend a group counseling session and individual counseling. Earlier at group the two counselors that moderate asked me to stay back as they felt concerned about my behavior and all. It wasn’t a conversation I wanted to have because I’m just especially tired and hurt today. And I don’t like groups and was only there to appease someone. And it was frustrating feeling like they couldn’t hear me and I was getting so agitated so I asked them to let me just be alone. 

I was lying on the floor trying to put myself back together and was finally feeling like I could finish my day when someone knocked the door. They’d gone to find my individual counselor and them to come check in with me. I opened the door ready to go and the second I saw them everything in me just froze. I couldn’t do it. I got hysterical and started yelling and I couldn’t breath and in that moment I knew that I wanted nothing more than to die and stop the screaming in my head, just fucking silence it.

I understand all those posts now. Nothing is getting better. I feel like my time is almost here and it takes such a weight off my shoulders. I’m not good anymore. I will never be good again.

I’m casually suicidal. By that I mean, I’m functioning perfectly fine. I’m going through the motions of a normal day - whatever the fuck that means right now.

If I walk across a road I’ll linger just a little too long and I’ll get disappointed every time I cross the road.

I’m not diagnosed with anything, slightly odd eating habits, never been incredibly happy, but nothing crazy. I just think I have a bit of a shitty life. 

When I think of killing myself it feels like a rational thought. A choice based on years and years of shitty situations. I’m not going insane, I’m sure of it. Which. I guess is what an insane person would say.

202839,"I feel like I'm living because its expected of me, not because I want to.Ive felt like life is too much of a struggle to keep living for the past 4 or 5 years.  Ive had suicidal thoughts since I was around 11 years old. They come and go, but every time they come it always seems to get worse. It was also around that time I started cutting up my arms.  A year ago I would of said ""I think about it, but I never make any plans and I wont ever go through with it"".  But as time went on I started looking up prices of shotguns or the most efficient way of killing myself and things like that.

I was diagnosed with depression around sophmore year of high school.  Since then I barely graduated high school, graduated tech school, and got a job.  All along the way I kept telling myself ""youll feel better eventually"" but I never have.  The only times I'm not thinking about suicide in some capacity is when Im mentally and physically exhausted from work, or if Im talking to my friend or something.  

I feel like I'm on autopilot for most of the day.  Days and weeks fly by and I can hardly remember what happened yesterday.  It could just be the routine Ive gotten into cuz of work, but the exact same thing happenes in high school.  The only difference is I cant sleep through work like I did school or else I lose my job.  

Suicidal thoughts have gone from occasional to weekly to daily.  Every single inconvenience in my life makes me just wish I didnt exist, or I could die in some accident so I didnt have to keep on living.  

I started smoking half a year ago after a sort of anxious episode at trade school and havent stopped despite a couple of attempts.  It went from 2 cigarettes a day to 7 to 10 and now to 20.  It helps me calm down a little bit, and works thousands of times better than any medication ive been prescribed.  Most of all it gives me a disturbing comfort in knowing that my life is being shortened, even by a little bit.

Before I went to a specialist ED unit I was on a general pych for two weeks as they were worried I was going to kill myself. While it didn’t help me, it kept me safe.

202883,lonely and desperateidk what to do anymore i don't trust anyone in my life anymore and i think they are either trying to sabotage me or don't want me in their company. it's really draining to not be able to even trust your own mom when shes the only person i really have left. if anyone wants to talk to me i'd be happy to have a conversation even if it is just momentary i would really appreciate it. idk i think even my family has begun to lose hope in me because i'm just getting worse everyday and isolating myself more. i'm just so paranoid everyone hates me i can barely move sometimes and it really limits my whole life and what i am able to do. i miss being blissfully ignorant but now i am too aware and i can't even distract myself from how lonely i am. nothing makes me happy and even when i am happy i beat myself up until i'm sad again. i'm just really devastated about being so alone but i hope it will change eventually. i'm trying to stay alive but i'm so miserable but my mom will kill herself if i do and my brothers are too young to be without her. i don't know what to do anymore i feel like there is no escape sometimes. it's like i'm just stuck in a corner watching the same shitty movie on loop. nothing feels real and i desperately need someone in my life right now.,suicide
202885,😔😔😔I’m losing the family I created because of my actions and my own family’s actions. I shared information about something in my relationship that I truly understand now that shouldn’t have shared and Then I asked them not to treat her differently and they started treating her like shit and disrespected her then to make matters worse I lied about it about me telling them for 5 months and had my bestfriend/ fiancé looking and feeling stupid since the past when I told her the truth during our fight. I only want her and my son in my life at this point. If it was up to me I would go back in time and do a lot of shit over. And take bac eveyythjgv I’ve done and maybe never involved my family at all.

202891,"Accepting things as they are/Class mobility.Hey SW.

I need some help trying to appreciate what I do have. I've been having really high ideation lately, mostly because of my socioeconomic status. I'm about to complete my associate's degree and feel like a B.A simply might not be in the cards.


I feel like I'm a reasonably smart guy, but I fear that life without a bachelor's degree, coming from a poor family is just going to be miserable. I'm trying to convince myself that ANY life, even that of a bum, is better than no life at all.

On the other hand, I feel like maybe if I can just bust ass, I can finish my bachelor's and have a ""better shot."" I just feel really crippled by my circumstances. 


I was also having a really crappy time at the beginning of the year, and managed to score myself a criminal record (retail theft), which is making it a lot harder to find work while I'm in school. It was an idiotic thing, not to mention fucking asshole-ish, thing to do, and I'm definitely not going to continue down that road. I just feel like the bed I have now laid for myself makes it really difficult to find happiness.


Basically, I'm just terrified of having to live poor. There's so much information suggesting that class mobility is effectively dead. But still, it HAS to be better to live poor than not live at all... right? It sounds so defeatist, but I just want to be one of those people who can be happy with an ""average"" job. Doing great things doesn't even matter to me that much anymore, I just want to be happy doing SOMETHING.


So... any advice? I'm honestly thinking about stopping school after my AA and just trying to find a decent full-time job, but on the other hand, I feel like I should give the B.A. a real shot. I just get so damn down on myself that it takes away from my ability to study and really try. I guess sort of just feel like if I settle with the AA, I can start my life and not worry so much about whether or not I'll get more education.",suicide

202910,"From monkey to koala. I'm sorry.This might be goodbye.

I have no reason to live. I don't have enough money for rent, let alone my medical bills. I'm starting to believe I'm not cut out for my dream career. I don't want to believe that I lost the love of my life. Did you read the messages/letter from Friday night?

For the first time it feels like I'm wearing the promise ring from a dead man. I feel sick. I can't eat. I can't sleep. Trust me, I've tried. I've been wearing your shirt again to feel you encompassing me.

I don't want my parents to know what happened this year. I rather they have a pleasant last memory of me. I don't want them to see this either. I'll write a letter and mail it to them, and tell them our star-crossed lovers' story. I know how they will best understand the news. Do not interfere with my parents.

I've tried to come up with countless scenarios of what you do during your extended silences, trying to believe in all that is good. My koala wouldn't hurt me, even though I've hurt him in ways no one could've imagined. Koala is a great person, a model human for our future children. Koala couldn't possibly be discovering the hidden gems and delicious foods of our hometown without me. Koala has classes to focus on anyway and needs to save money. But then I began to question my beliefs after you said you continue to see her. I didn't notice there were two rocks in the photo you sent me. Did you go there with her? Please don't take her to Aroma, Via Cibo, and Maha's, that is my dying wish.

I wanted you to call last night so I could hear two things from you. 1) that you love me and 2) that our chapter isn't over. You are the reason I want to live. I couldn't fall back asleep last night after waking up within 3 hours of falling asleep. I puked last night. I puked again this morning on my bed, and then in the bathroom sink when I realized there was more. It was just yellow vile liquid, my stomach is empty.

Without you by my side, I want to run away from this life. You, the person who asked me to marry you, albeit lightheartedly, were the only person I cared for and loved so intensely. Maybe I should start a new life as a nomad. But I don't have any money. Each life ends with the same result. So what if it's early? I have nothing to look forward to. I imagined our future as the only future. We supported each other through all the rough times. I knew even if my dream career wasn't attainable, you would support my plan B, C and all the way to Z. I met you when you were a freight member at HD, and I didn't walk away. I let other people's thoughts cloud my own, and I shouldn't have. They don't know you the way i know you. I love you.

I'll wear the rings as always, and the shirt you wore on our first date, it only seems fitting for the end. Full circle.

I will love you until my last breath. We'll recreate the moment we met in heaven. I'll be waiting.

Goodbye",suicide

I just wanted to post my thoughts. I‘m 18 and i live in germany. I got diagnosed with depression and a personality disorder. I‘m in therapy but i don‘t feel any better. I seeked help because i don‘t want to live like this. I‘m crying every night because life is so painful to me. My mom died because of suicide too. She was a great mother. She got money and seemed happy. My dad abused her, cheated on her and took is away from our mom. At this point i didn‘t knew that life is going to be awful. My Dad tried to control my life and abused me. He was very violent. One day he kicked me out with 17 years because of my sexuality. I lived at my Friends house for a month or so. And then i had to go into the childrens shelter, where i tried to take my life by suffocating with a plasticbag but i stopped because i started to cry because i Don‘t want to hurt my brothers,my boyfriend and my aunt. After 3 Months i moved to my aunt. I was absolutely emotionally destroyed. Of course my aunt has stricter rules than my dad because she knows how life is. But i‘m not used to it. i‘m Already trying so hard to improve (especially for myself) but i can‘t. I‘m a looser. My Grades are bad, because i‘m so depressed everytime. I can‘t cope with life.

202919,"Crippled by stress and debt. Seriously considering ending it.Look at my previous post on r/cscareerquestions  


I'm crippled by debt and stress. I had an expensive operation done that showed everything was okay two days before being laid off. So now I owe this money they refuse to write off.   


I also owe about 6000 in credit card debt that I took on under the assumption that I'd be doing great by now. That doesn't include the 40k in student loans. I had managed to save up about 4k in savings when I held my job for 4 months. I was making a plan to get debt free in about 5 years. That was 2 months ago and I'm almost out of money.  


I thought I was doing great. I thought I was learning and getting ready to start a career in software development. Then my last interviews feedback basically told me I'm still just a tiny beginner. I didnt' work hard enough. I didn't put enough effort into it. Meanwhile a guy I graduated with is making 6 figures after two years.   


So my dreams of traveling are gone. My dreams of being debt free are gone. I can't get a job in my chosen field. The job I did have as a developer was a fluke. It was pure dumb luck. It was false hope for 4 months. Then it was taken from me. I was finally learning to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'll never succeed. My education was garbage and I owe a shit ton of money i'll never pay off.   


I literally can't not think of stress and debt at any given moment. I've lost all joy and can't relax. I'm literally physically crippled by these thoughts and can't escape them. When they do subside and I suddenly start thinking about it again, I feel like a suffocating wave wash over me. I just want it to stop.  


So, why should I suffer if I'm going to be poor the rest of my life? I made a real effort to get my shit together 5 years ago when I realized that, at 25, I had nothing and was working in a dead end minimum wage job. I decided to go back to school. Worst mistake of my life. I have something now. It's 50k in debt and nothing else.  


I really thought I'd be okay by now. I really thought what I was doing was right and that I was making a positive change in my life. I just turned 30 at the beginning of the month.  


All I want out of life is to travel the world. I'll never get that. So why should I continue? Isn't it better to live a short, happy life instead of a long one full of misery? If I'm gonna die anyway, I'd rather not suffer for another 30+ years. The only way i'm gonna stick around is if my debt goes away. That's not gonna happen. So why should I?",suicide

202922,"How do I make it stopWho knew hanging around them would make this all happen? I was just looking for friends my own age. Well, I can’t blame them because they were just being themselves. Maybe it was me; maybe it was just me. But I was just being myself too.

The move wasn’t just hard because I was an outsider who couldn’t speak their language fluently; no. It was also that I was someone they didn’t expect to be. I wasn’t stereotypical, and I grew up in a different way; a way none of the others had grown up. It wasn’t hard for me to understand how they grew up, why was it so hard for them to understand mine? I would cry every time they’d call me that. Every. Single. Time. Maybe I don’t show it anymore like I used to, but I still always cry. It’s as simple as a sentence for them, but it’s my self-confidence, my self-esteem, my anxiety, my identity and my existence. Oh, if I only knew how much worse things would get and how it wouldn’t change at all, I perhaps wouldn’t have prolonged living for so long. Perhaps I shouldn’t prolong it now as well. Why am I still here?

All of those things, which I think I had before it all started, has dissipated completely. Now, every time I breathe I hate myself more. Every time I walk, I can’t stop thinking about how stupid I probably look. Every time I talk I think about how squeaky my voice sounds. Just that one sentence.

Maybe people don’t say it anymore, but those voices definitely restate those words again and again. How do I make all the voices stop? They never go away. All those voices make it all worse.

But, hey, it “gets better”. I don’t know if I actually believe that sentence, but HOW could it get worse? Life has always found a way. But how? It’s bad enough

Maybe death is how it finally gets better? It's in a way a sad feeling but also a very peaceful one. It's comforting knowing that there is nothing I have to worry about. I don’t have to worry about that one thought that never went away or that class which I couldn’t succeed in.

I don’t know how to conclude this. Should I die or continue existing? I’m not sure, but I can’t take this much longer. I can’t meet anyone without me wondering if they’re thinking that one thing. But I’m not that, as much as I wish I were, so it could stop hurting every time; But I’m not",suicide

Let me tell you where I stand. A horrible father, a horrible husband. What the fuck is wrong with me? What the fuck am I going to do? I fucked us all over. 5 people that counted on me, that looked to me for direction. I am thankful my kids are much too young to understand the position we are in. My wife hates me now. Almost 7 years of progress, down the tubes. From homelessness in the snow, refusing to go to a shelter because they&amp;apos;d split us up. I remember the love we had, that we&amp;apos;d rather sit huddled up in the trees in 7 degree weather in blinding snow overnight without a blanket than be split up for a couple hours at the shelter. I remember when it was genuine when she told me she loved me, we were so young. Married at 19, she was 18. I fell for her instantly. Now that phrase is just used as a formality, the same way you&amp;apos;d say &amp;quot;bless you&amp;quot; to someone that sneezed on the bus. I remember when she was so perfect, when I was her everything, and she was mine. There was nobody in the world but her. No family, no friends, no mom or dad to cry and plead to. We did it together, we know the struggle and we made it together. I still think of those cold nights, even miss them sometimes, where we would have killed for a sip of whiskey to keep warm. God it was miserable but the love was so real. I miss that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now all we do is fight. She yells at me, talks down to me. I don&amp;apos;t blame her. I&amp;apos;m a fuck up. I cracked big time under pressure more than once. I can&amp;apos;t keep it together. This isn&amp;apos;t the first time. I deserve all of it, if you ask me, I don&amp;apos;t get enough.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We got off the streets and had kids. We both worked our asses off to give them everything. I remember walking 4, 5 miles home, soaked to the bone in the middle of winter after washing dishes for 12 hours every day 6 days a week, getting home to change and then going to another job, and then another. No idea how I did it without meth haha. But it was no problem, I was proud to be amongst the millions of the WORKING poor class who&amp;apos;s story is like mine, because for every guy like me, there were 10 other people on the street median holding their kids as objects to gain sympathy with a sign in hand. Fuck them. I&amp;apos;d rather my kids learn how to get a job, than have them learn how to write tearjerking signs on cardboard. What productive members of society will they be?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ah then things got hard. Obamacare, hour cuts, layoffs. It hit the job I had at the time hard. From 40 hours a week down to 32, overnight. My wife was completely let go of hers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And it just got tougher. The animosity grew. The stress level rose. Anxiety took hold of me like a motherfucker. After all these years of working for no gain, which is fine, at least we didn&amp;apos;t starve, at least we had a place of our own, I find myself doing the most ridiculous things. Paranoid. Always dreading something. 

I laugh about it a little. Some of the things I do. For some reason, Im scared to be seen by the neighbors. No rational reason why. When I need to go to the store to buy milk, I wait until after midnight and I&amp;apos;ll sit by the curtain and watch for up to a half hour to make sure no one is outside. Then I sneak down the stairs and powerwalk to the street corner out of view. Hahahah

So the issue at hand.... my wife and I live in a tourist town. Just for discretion sake, I wont say where. But we both had seasonal jobs. We both got cut loose in January. Havent been able to find work since. Pisses me off because I am employable and WANTING to work. I know how to work, I know how to find a job. Just never get any bites when I need it the most. 

Wife stresses out. I understand why. Late Feb comes, rent statement. So far behind. What the fuck. As the man, I pretend to be calm and collected. She cries. Talked about how we hae been living here for over 3 years and now its over. Its okay. I will take care of it. She says I know you will.

I walk to the day labor spot, every day. Scarce work. But thats my solution to everything. Work it off. Didnt realize the 40 bucks a day, 3 days a week wasnt adding up.

Started going door to door on days I wasn&amp;apos;t getting sent out and asking everyone if I could clean their yards or other shit like that for 10 bucks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
March 2nd hits. 3 day notice, pay or quit. For some reason, they never filed with the court because we made it to about the 12th when we got our tax money. Paid it all off. Relief. And I still had some money left over to buy a car. A luxury we never bad before. People don&amp;apos;t realize how much the job market opens up once your mobile. Had a revoked license I had to take care of. But I had 2 job offers from the neighboring city about 45 minutes away paying significantly more than what I ever made down here. The job I really had my eye on was even cool enough to hold the position open for me til I got my license squared away. No problem, looked at it like an investment for our future. Fuel pump burns out when my wife drove it. Then the battery died too. Maybe from overcranking it when the car wouldn&amp;apos;t start? I dunno. Now I have a paperweight that can fetch about 175 at the scrapyard. But I am pretty scared to let it go because if we end up on the street, would be nice to have something to sleep in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then the lights go out. Fuck. That&amp;apos;s right. They trusted me to take care of everything. How the fuck could I forget that? With kids in the house, my hands were tied. I had to pay it. No payment arrangement. They want it in full. Down another 375. We are in line for state utility assistance, but normally don&amp;apos;t get approved til the end of April because they give you one lump sum on your food stamp card to pay something like 6 months worth. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;apos;m such a fucking moron. Fuck, I thought I had it all figured out. Now we have nothing. They eat well, food stamps are generous. But fuck, I should have known better. Why didn&amp;apos;t I know how to do simple budgeting? I normally keep track of every single penny in the household.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tell myself I was blinded by a life changing opportunity. And it was. The wage gaps were ridiculous. I thought about all the shit we could do with the money. Hell, we would even have enough to put in a savings account now.&lt;br&gt;
But that&amp;apos;s what I tell myself. But it&amp;apos;s an excuse to make myself feel better about fucking everything up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So now I have been exposed as an idiot. The jig is up. Now she can&amp;apos;t stand me. Her and the kids sleep in our bedroom now. I sit up all night in the living room for days on end trying to plan my next move. By the time the sun comes up, every morning, there is no next step. Sell the car. That&amp;apos;s about it. Could bring the cash straight to the landlord. They&amp;apos;d laugh me out of the office. Okay... what do I do after that... blank.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No idea why thet haven&amp;apos;t brought me another 3 day notice yet. I expect and deserve no leniency. Fuck, I just got done paying off back rent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;apos;s going home. I understand why. The kids deserve better. The kids deserve someone better to call dad. It&amp;apos;s too late. It&amp;apos;s over. And she calls me delusional. And she&amp;apos;s right. For some reason I keep going on with life like it&amp;apos;s okay. Like the family isn&amp;apos;t splitting apart. Like how my everything is fading away. Her family hates me. I used to be a bad person when we dated. This just gives them more ammo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She said she doesn&amp;apos;t love me anymore. She said how could I possibly love and care about them if the thought didn&amp;apos;t occur to me to do something as simple as budget correctly. She&amp;apos;s right. This is all so stupid, but all my fault.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now the only thing I look forward to are having memories. Watching my 3 year old playing minecraft. My oldest daughter telling me my &amp;quot;sammiches&amp;quot; are awesome. She starts school this year. &lt;br&gt;
Guess I better get it together. It&amp;apos;s funny, I&amp;apos;ll be heading back to the same thicket of trees that we camped in together. When she was my everything. But I guess this time I&amp;apos;ll be there freezing alone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;apos;t get a grip. I can&amp;apos;t come to terms. Like clockwork I sit out here in the dark living room, 3AM crying and living the past in my head. She&amp;apos;s what my heart beats for. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;apos;t imagine sitting in this empty apartment waiting for the deputy to do the eviction. The quiet. No crying baby. No toddlers fighting over toys. No laughing. No playing. No kids to yell at about knocking off the noise because it&amp;apos;s late. No I love yous. Nobody in the bed next to me. No one to sit up late at night with, watching the same stupid reruns of Frasier with, talking about how someday we were gonna make it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is just too much for me to bare. I just hope she knows that I still love her. I hope my kids know how much I love them too. She&amp;apos;s gonna make it. Shes smart.

A little backstory, I’ve been struggling with PTSD, depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a very young girl. I recently got diagnosed with unspecified DID and I’ve been going to therapy since June this year. Despite all that I had a pretty normal life. I recently moved out on my own, I have a social life and a partner and I’m trying to finish my year in High School. 

My partner and I have been through pretty much every corner of hell since we met. Yet he still stayed with me despite me trying multiple times to break things off because I’m scared I might hurt him. He’s the opposite of me, never had any major life problems and always had a loving childhood, family and friends.

Something was ingrained in me at a young age that made me think every decision was of vital importance so I better not mess up.  So now I'm sitting here at 34 knowing that I need to eventually end it because nothing I've done has added up to anything.

I was getting better for this past year, I really was.  For the first time I actually felt like I was working towards a regular life, of not just wasting everything that was given to me.  Then she tells me we have to be better on our own and reinforcing how absolutely meaningless my actions are.  

Last night I tried to get help and was endlessly amused and frustrated that all the help lines were busy.  I'm trying to talk to friends and family, to let them know how much of a disappoint me I am, but no idea how that will pan out.

202959,"I was peer pressured Waddup waddup, I don’t often talk about how I feel, but bottling up emotions has been happening too often to me so I decided to put this here.

About five days ago my mom brought up the regional contest every year. Basically you have your instrument , play it, and if you’re good enough you make it in the orchestra. My mom mentions how she would really want me to go for scholarship reasons, but I don’t like competing really, I just wanna have fun and play in my school orchestra.

My directors are also super active in getting ppl to try out, and how this year is gonna be the best time to try out since you’ll only have to record yourself instead of physically being there. Well, I still didn’t really want to do it, but I did put more thought into it. I asked my friends if I should as a final decision. Big mistake. I have great friends but most of the time they’re too supportive so of course they said yes, I can do it. So I signed up and that was that.

I thought I had another 1 month to practice the piece, but in reality the audition was in the next week. Everyone else started learning the music 2 months ago and I haven’t even looked at the piece. Either I was going to be a prodigy and do this is a week or just flunk it.

So why did I sign up like an idiot? In my orchestra, everyone is taking this audition, literally everyone. All my friends in orchestra are also doing it. No, this wasn’t an experience where I wanted to join them and be cool, I just didn’t want to get left behind.

I never was in orchestra for a scholarship, because my friends joined it, or because I didn’t want to do band. I stayed in orchestra because I really liked it. Everyone says how a class can become a family, and honestly the orchestra never felt like a family to me, whenever we had competitions I was one of those kids who would sit alone and not talk to others. I hated that, but  I stayed because playing in a group was so fun. I never wanted this “passion” to get competitive, but everyone else was leaving and either I had to catch up with them or I didn’t have an orchestra to play with.

Anywho, with a small pep talk with my dad, I feel better cause I don’t want to make Region. I’m not going to purposefully flunk the audition, I’ll try but I’m gonna hope I don’t make it. I have others hobbies that i would love to focus on as well. 

TL;DR : my mom and friends “pushed” me to try out for an orchestra audition I had a week to prepare for. I didn’t want to do it but I signed up anyway.",non-suicide

My family doesn’t care about me that much and still wants perfection even though I’m not perfect.

I unintentionally got into an argument between my family because my mom (who i love dearly) has often been mistreated and yelled at even because she’s an unemployed housewife. When I brought it up that we should still try to be nice to her and shouldn’t pressure her to do things she doesn’t want to do, my brother got defensive, and we began arguing. My father eventually hopped in. This led to a heated discussion between me and my brother/my dad, which lead to my dad saying something along the lines of “you’re the reason why things are so messed up here.” I immediately screamed, backed away and cried.I yelled and screamed more than once that I wasn’t comfortable with living here, how my mom deserved better than what we were doing, and that I really wanted to die and have thought about it for quite sometime...

... and they basically just brushed all of that off.

I couldn’t believe it. All they said was it’s not religious, I was too sensitive, “I should just pray more,” and that it would look bad for everyone here. That’s how important I was to them; not as a human being or a son or a brother, but just something to make them look and feel better. I could tell from their eyes, tone, and laughing demeanor that that’s all they cared about. I felt horrible. And although I do consider myself as sensitive, I refuse to accept that as an excuse for such shitty behavior. 

Eventually, they just left me to my room hoping I would calm down. But I swear if I had something to instantly take the pain away after my dad told me that, I would’ve done it.

I wish I could do something for my mom and I. Save us from this terrible oppression and house without love. Idk what to do, but that’s all I have to say about it.",suicide

When I was younger and I would think about suicide it would make me really upset and I would cry but now I find myself thinking about it all the time. It's almost a relief now when I think about ending my life. Like I can put an end to this.

I'm 27 years old with an associates degree in computer science. I have held a programming job for three years which is a miracle considering I  am a terrible programmer. The job is toxic. I go in everyday with the fear that I will finally be found out as the phony that I am. My boss also likes to make matters worse by constantly putting me down.

I have recently come to to terms with the fact that I am a transgendered person. I was hoping that finally admitting it to myself would make some of this pain go away but it only intensified it. I feel like an inferior person.

I don't want to type out all my problems. I'm scared because I've never felt this calm and collected when thinking about ending my life. I imagine that after I die there will just be nothing, and I yearn for that nothingness, where there are no more decisions to make.

I've struggled with depression since middle school, which is when I started self harming. My dad found out, and locked me in a car with him and threatened me if I ever did it again. He was super manipulative and verbally abusive my entire life, and blamed me when my brother molested me when I was 11. Needless to say, it's been rough.

I'm in college now, only in my second quarter, and things have been bad. I started self harming again (I had been clean for about 3 years) I'm struggling to eat much anymore, and get so stressed I'll throw up. I've essentially been isolating myself. 

Idk if I'd say I'm entirely suicidal, I definitely feel suicidal, feel like I'd like to die, but that's how I've always explained it, a FEELING, no plans, no actions. I've got lots of reasons to keep trying, to keep going, but that doesn't mean I'm not struggling. I don't have a lot of friends at college, but I've got a nice community of people online who I've known for years. The one I've known the longest has been my lifeline since I was probably about 14 (met when I was 12, I'm 18 now) in a lot of ways, she's become a mother figure to me. I'm planning on visiting her this summer, and I love her to death.

About a month ago, it turned out my best friend had been lying to me for more than a year, and I still can't really talk to her. I'm heartbroken and it's hit me hard. The friend I mentioned before was involved as well, but because she's such a big support for me, we've been talking anyways. I mentioned how bad I've been doing, and she's been talking with me for a few days. Yesterday I was cutting again, and I mentioned it to her (I'm trying to hold myself accountable, instead of hiding it from her.) I want to stop, and I'm trying to stop, but it's been taking time and is much harder than last time I tried to stop. I skype called her before I went to bed and put on cam so she could watch out for me (I usually get really depressed at night when I'm all alone), and we talked a little, before I broke down crying out of nowhere. 

This morning I woke up, took my final, got back from class and then there's a knock at my door, and it's three police officers outside my dorm. We go outside and talk. They tell me that someone told them I'm gonna kill myself (never told my friend that I had any plans or anything) I told them about how I have been struggling for a while, but I've been working hard and seeking help. I've started seeing a new psychologist, psychiatrist and I'm on new meds (thought they haven't started working yet) but they looked over my arms (no cuts, I cut on my leg) and had me talk to some crisis lady on the phone, and that was enough for them to be satisfied I'm fine. We talked for a while about other stuff, and they seemed really nice. 

My main questions, what can I expect moving forward. Is this going to stay on my ""record"" or whatever, they mentioned they were gonna contact my psychologist, but are they going to contact my parents. If my dad finds out he's going to freak and probably take it out on me. I'm not at home any more, but I'm worried he's gonna like, cut off all financial support. Are they gonna come and find me again? If they see my cuts are they gonna send me to the hospital? I'm really kinda freaked out.

I did confirm that it's my friend who called them. I'm a bit surprised, but I'm not upset, I know it's because she's worried and because she cares. I just wish she had come to me first, though I suppose she would rather be safe than sorry (especially since she's so far away, and can't do much if there was an emergency). I haven't really talked with her about it though, other than how much I love her and appreciate how much she cares for me. But yeah.

Who do you tell when you feel like you can't tell anyone? I tell my girlfriend, she leaves me because I'm crazy. I tell my family, they lock me up in like a psychiatric hospital. I have roommates. But I know they'll escalate it to their parents or my parents or people I don't want knowing. And if I lose what little I have left, I'll go down and probably won't make it back out.

Who do you tell when you feel like you can't tell anyone?",suicide

203081,"The only thing that keeps me from ending it all is the pain I'll put my mom through if I do itI literally have nothing to excite me. I haven't been out in the fresh air for already 5 months now because i'm recovering from a fracture. I have the brittle bones disease, and I fracture my legs easily. I don't have friends to come by. I also have OCD and ADHD, so, learning anything is very hard. My GF broke up with me. I feel like I can't stand up for me, or for anyone I love (well, I don't just feel like it, it's true). 
So, that's that... I also forgot to mention that I'm 20 years old.
People keep telling me to ""look at Hawking and see how he could do all these things yet be paralyzed on a wheelchair"" 
This actually angers me bacause there's a lot of difference between me and that person. 
Anyway, I just feel like ending it all. I don't fear death. I just want to stop existing. This idea has been around for a long time, and it's only reasonable. It's not like I'll lose anything.
But then, I can't do this to my mom. She's gone through a lot to give me a good life. 
I don't know, but I think probably some day I'll just stop caring, and I'll do it. 
Oh, and the GF I was talking about, I've never even seen her. We'd been chatting online for a long time. My stupid self was emotionally connected to someone online. She made me want to live so I can go and see her one day. She helped me a lot actually. I felt like I could beat anything with her.
But then we broke up, and I don't have anything to fight for, again.

203082,"Advice neededAsking for a friend who's in school:
1.People in the classroom would talk shit about her and they think that she cant hear but in fact they are ""whispering"" really loudly.
2. The same group of people would openly express their hostility towards her by showing disgust at her presence and on some occassions make their dislike very obvious (when there are grpwork they would check to see if they were on the same team with my friend and if theyre not they would literally high five each other)
3. Whenever my friend tries to talk to them they would straight up treat her existence like air.
All of this rlly affects her as she have nvr been so openly hated before and worse of all she doesnt have any friends in school (im only friends with her outside school), and everyone seems to be spectators watching the show refusing to help just bc the grp of people who bullies her are considered ""popular"" and not to be messed with.
She became rlly fearful of gng to school, told her parents and me abt the situation but there was nth we could rlly do, as she is afraid of confronting them too, bc there is a risk of further elevating the situation. Now she cant concentrate on even her studies(she was a straight A student) as this constantly plagues her mind.

I am exhausted from lack of sleep. The only thing stopping me from throwing myself off the bridge into the river today is that my son texted me to wish me happy birthday and that him and his brothers want to take me out for ice cream later. And I can't just leave them. If it weren't for the fact I still have them in my life and that I need to continue to support them and be there for them, I would otherwise end my life today. Families gathering at the park for picnics, fireworks going off last night, but nothing arranged for me. Not that it would even happen since people who I thought were my friends all ghosted me after the divorce anyways and the only supposed friend I have has never seemed to be able to remember when my birthday is for like the last 25 years. My brother asked if I could help him out with work today to do deliveries and didn't even remember it was my birthday and I had to remind him I am living out of my car and can't help. Knowing the only people I would be hurting by ending my life are my kids and maybe my family, today I will continue to hold on. This is not a cry for pity or sympathy.

My brother (16) opened my door without asking, and forcefully made me have a heated conversation with him about my paint. He wanted art supplies. He then said “u better lose ur attitude. I’m getting tired of it” like what a parent says to a child. It’s always me who has to obey him. After he said that, he left. I locked the door. My dad said something that I didn’t respond to. I felt bad about that. And then I started crying. I hate hormones. But why can’t he just not talk to me? That’s the best solution. If he doesn’t talk to me, and I don’t talk to him, then we won’t have any conflicts and bad feelings. He needs to be aware of what’s happening to me right now. Hormones, I think, cause me to act like this. This is not an excuse. And yesterday me and my friend argued, and it was horrible. I hate arguing. And I still have a lot of schoolwork that’s due. Everything is stressing me out, so I watched YouTube. YouTube calmed me down, and took me out of this world for a while. And then he interrupted this delicate peace, making it horrible again. He needs to observe, and think, “why is she acting this way? Maybe something is wrong with ME (him)”. Or we could just both ignore each other, which I think is the best solution. And I hate it when he acts like he’s better than me, and like I’m a lesser person. He always talks down to me. And my first reaction is to always cry, and I don’t know why, but it just sucks.

The second they were in my stomach, suddenly I was waking up in my bed 5 minutes later, with no memory of having taken them. An hour later, their usual effects hit me.

And now I'm thinking about then. If I took all 76 pills I have left, it would probably be similar. It would probably knock me out instantly, right? And for longer? Just like that first time?

All the documented cases I've read about of suicides with DPH were around a gram of the stuff. And any documentation I can find about fatal doses says that a gram is only fatal for someone lightweight or sensitive to it, but that doses closer to 2 grams are nearly assured to kill anybody. Well, I'm lightweight and sensitive to it, so I'd think that this dose of nearly 2 grams would assuredly kill me, yes?

I don't want there to be a chance of me waking up in the morning with a killer headache, or waking up in the hospital a week, or weeks, later, with possible brain damage, or worse.

203099,"How do I help someone I loveI’m here not for myself but for someone I really care about... my fiancée has been suicidal in the past and has been having a tough time lately because of work, her being alone while I’m on leave, and not being as successful as she wants to be at this point in her life.

Work: she works remotely for a nonprofit 100% of the time so she is literally alone when working and only interacts over email, Slack or the phone and when I’m home. I work in an office 4 days a week and can work from home Wednesday’s but even on Wednesday’s we are both buried in work even at home. She recently found out a couple things about work like her boss just signed a consultant to take some load off of her but is getting compensated almost 4x what she got doing the same thing a year ago ($22 vs $87/hr). That is bs imho. She also found out another employee is getting paid $50k more than her annually doing less work... I’ve tried to tell her that I understand that the situation is shitty and the best thing u can do is show face and just look for a new job to leave. What makes it even worse is we are supposed to go to her boss’ wedding next weekend. I’m okay with not going but expressed that we probably should go to not make things awkward. Plus we already paid for the trip.

Being alone: as mentioned above, she works remote and works her ass off to get paid less than other employees. She’s in a position where if she slacks, nothing will get done vs if the others slack, she picks up the pieces. She’s obviously getting taken advantage of... I took a 2 week vacation to visit my mom and grandma because they’re getting old and my fiancée was fine with me going on this trip until I was actually gone she started feeling lonely and scared. I’m going back on Wednesday but she keeps saying she might not be alive when I get back... 

Not being successful: I tell her everyday to be thankful for what she has vs what she doesn’t and that seems to just piss her off. I want her to realize that we have a house, we have been together for 8 years and hoping to be married by next year. She has a loving family with her parents, sister and her niece and nephew. And me. That’s success to me... but she is always hard on herself how she hasn’t been able to get into a job she wants. Not being able to be smart enough to get into an MBA program. She says it’s too late for her cuz she’s already 28 and people getting their dream job out of college or an MBA right after their bachelors.

Me: I’ve been always optimistic. But I’ve been burned by fake friendships, my mistakes, jobs, I even moved out of a previous job to support her wanting to move to a different place and had to pay back a bonus I received because it didn’t vest for another 4 months. Despite that, I’m still here. What advice can I give her to take away the pain other than suicide? I love her as a whole even with these problems she’s had because she was there for me when we first met. She gave me advice on how to organize, be a leader, etc. if it wasn’t for her, I probably wouldn’t have had the optimistic mindset I have now... I want to help her the same way she’s helped me.",suicide

203102,"Desperate plea for helpI'm back here again because I have no one. It seems like everyone disappears in my time of need. Everything that has been hurting me has been amped up to a ten. I am a senior graduating in 2 days. I have 5 essays, 2 projects and 3 tests to do. But I can't do them do to this burning dull pain in my chest. Can't sleep either. I just lie in bed hoping the hollow feeling would go away. Maybe I could do work. I am not graduating, as I currently am failing too many classes. I have been extremely isolated the past 4 years and have not formally hung out with any friend in 2 years. I go outside once or twice a week, and the only people I have contact with is family. But I constantly argue with them and they have been more and more aggressive towards my ""lazy and childish behavior"". I don't even want to talk about girls. I am never asking another one out again. I am the holy grail of unattractive. I am short, have extremely bad teeth, have a weird looking face, complete lack of confidence and self love, and extremely needy. And due to this, I have asked over 60 girls out and all said no. I am a kissless hugless virgin with no life skills and I'm turning 19 in less than 4 months. I lost all my willpower and ego with that, and have not even attempted to contact any girls in my classes even though I like a few. Same with friends. Constant ghosting and unreliability has made me extremely paranoid. If someone does even the slightest of nicest things to me I'll snap and call them a liar or trying to take advantage of me. I have stopped talking to pretty much everyone. I feel like there are no options. I have been treated like a joke my entire life. I don't think I can get those assignments done, ask out that girl, and do my best to recover from this living nightmare. But the pain, paranoia, fear, solitude, anger are all just too much.

I'm sorry for being a liar.

I'm sorry for not understanding.

I'm sorry for everything. 

My life could be a lot worse than it is but I feel as if it's been living hell. I'm growing up as a failure, knowing that I have no future and that I serve no purpose on earth. I try my best to live everyday but things are difficult. I try to just smile, be happy, and ignore the feelings but I realize that I'm just lying to myself. I can't just keep trying to make everyone around me happy. What I'm trying to say is, I give up. I give up on life, even if I continue living I'm not going to try to make things better.

I know that nothing will change for me, everything will just get worse. Eventually I'll be an adult, unable to hold a job and too poor to afford medication. At least I'm not there yet, but...I should stop burdening people. I should just stop depending on people and just go fail on my own. At least then no one would have to deal with me.

 im exhausted....and anxious...and i feel like im fake.. 

 maybe i'll look better if i lose more weight..

 I wanna die lol

 

My parents told me that people who are AMAB (they said men but I'm being inclusive) don't deal with sexual assault or rape because they are the ones who do it. They say that I'm a liar and that it was not possible, they say just because I think I'm a girl doesn't mean that it has happened. They don't let me talk about it when I'm affected most by it. I'm treated as if nothing has ever happened. I don't know how to feel anymore. The more I'm told it doesn't happen the more I start telling myself that it never happened. Maybe that's better to just pretend nothing ever happened, but it will always take me to a dark place. I'll never talk about it again.

 

No matter what anyone tells me, I still feel the same. They tell me that pain is pain, and that just because other people have it worse doesn't mean that my struggles are irrelevant. I think they're lying. What gives me the right to even think that I'm suffering? I don't deserve to have help from people or to even have the feelings I do. I should just shut up and live my petty little life.

&amp;#x200B;

 

What the fuck do I have left?? Everyone fucking betrays me no one really gives two shits! Why? Why? why the fuck am I like this?? Why can't people treat me right?? Everything is so fucking screwed up. Everything should just disappear! I want to fucking tear everything apart! Why cant everyone just drop dead?? stop telling me its my fault. Stop telling me to change. Stop pretending like everything is good. Your all fucking liars!! Go to hell fucking go to hell! Why the fuck do you think I turned out this way?? Why the fuck do you think I'm so messed up?? It's your fault. It's fucking your fault. 

 I'm used to being told I look gross. I know I do, I can't always wear makeup to cover it up. That's why I always wear a mask so no on will have to see it. So I don't have to see it. The pain is still there, I don't need reminders of how I look. *When I get upset about it I just tell myself that I'm like a real life Todoroki but without the superpowers. if only I was hot like Todoroki.* I'm used to being told I'm fake. Accepting my disorders has been difficult enough, I don't need more people telling me that I'm lying and that I'm making others look bad. Those people are helping me, because they know what it's like living like I am. None of this is easy and it's very real. Sometimes it's too much for me to handle so I break down. I'm used to being told I'm creepy. It doesn't matter how high the dose of anti-psychotics is, I will never not suffer. I will always have delusions, I can't stop them or get rid of them. I hate it, you really think I like it?! I don't. I've lived with it my whole life. I want it all to change, I wish that I didn't have to deal with myself or my mind. I will always do what I want, how I want, in a way that makes sense to me. I'm used to being looked down upon by everyone. I'll never be smart, in any way shape or form. I can't do normal things like everyone else. I'm not even really living, I haven't been alive since I was little. People are always disgusted by my existence, they look at me like at least I'm not her. They avoid me and talk to me as if I'm a little kid. I'm used to not being wanted. Everyone wants me to be gone, the only people who like me are online. I'm not planning on dying because I still have 5 years of having hope. I don't have friends or a family that cares for me. I'm on my own. I'm aware of that, so right now in this moment, I'm grateful I have something left. 

 I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar 

 I've never been able to tell real from fake. So this is probably the same, everything is just made up in my head because I couldn't just believe that I was like the other girls. I'm just deceiving myself and everyone's playing along. *nothing has happened you just want attention it's all lies you tell yourself you're just faking you make all of us look bad* People just don't want to tell you that you're just dreaming. You just want to be someone you're not. Maybe you should just kill yourself to make up for all the people you cause problems for. You seem to have funning cutting. So go do it.

 I don't want to fall apart again 

 *I need help* 

I am stupid I am annoying I am a burden I am a waste of space I am a liar I am fake I should cut I should die I should not exist I should be forgotten

 its my fault its all my fault i ruin everything

 I really really really need to die, it doesn't matter to people whether I'm dead or alive because why would it matter? No one really cares, why would anyone care? I can't do this anymore. 

Eventually everyone will forget about me, I'll forget everyone. Everyone's faces will become obscure and I'll be alone again. Who am I kidding? I've always been alone.

I used to be pretty fat and ugly, but my appearance has started to hit different after I got glasses and I started working out. But, I have a couple issues that I need to address and I'm confused on how to do so. For one, my grades are dropping, mostly because I lack motivation. I've tried just pushing through it, but it's not working because of COVID stopping me from indulging in everything I like to do. Secondly, I just feel depressed. Not like suicide depressed. But I barely feel anything anymore. All the things I used to find fun aren't fun anymore, not because I'm growing up and my interests are changing, (been there done that), but because I've done pretty much everything I've found interesting already at least 5 times. All the good shows on Netflix? I finished the last one at the end of summer. Video Games? Played all of the free ones. (I'm a bit tight on money.) But that's not all. I feel like I'm different from last year, that something that used to be a part of me is gone. Now I just feel like a lesser version of what I used to be. I've also developed a bad stuttering problem. I'm not killing myself anytime soon, it's too much of a gamble. But what should I do?

I lost everyone from college I only talk to two people and I'm sure they are sick and tired of me complaining and always being sad. Nobody gets it I don't have anything to live for. When I go back I know I will be alone. That is why when i go back in the spring I have decided that if my life doesn't improve by my birthday ( in the spring) I will kill myself. My reasoning is that I am w family for the next six months and I don't want them to witness my death and be scarred. I'm only alive because of my family and that's not fair.

My sister took pictures of me naked and threatened to send them to her friends. One year later when I was 10 I realized that I was depressed. Throughout this time she would intentionally fuck with me any way she could. She would wake me up any time I slept despite her knowing about my sleeping disorder, would constantly break and destroy anything that was valuable to me, and would intentionally anger me. She did this nearly everyday for about 4-5 years. She enjoyed seeing me in pain. She didn't stop at just anger though, this was the type of anger that would make your blood boil. She would do things all of the time like this and would talk bad about me or put me in awful social situations intentionally even though I had terrible anxiety that would make me freeze up so easily. She made fun of me for being depressed, and constantly treated me like shit for so many years. One time I even broke my hand because of the pain she was causing me. Just a few months ago, she forced me to upon up about all of these things despite me making it fucking clear that this was a terrible idea that would lead to destructive results but she kept pushing and manipulating like how she always does like the piece of human shit that she is. I guess it's my fault for feeling bad for her (mostly because I see the same type of pain in her). The problem is that now I've become toxic and possibly insane. About a year ago I stopped feeling emotion and even didn't feel anything at the funeral of my friend's father, my health is in terrible condition despite being 15, and I don't know fiction from reality anymore. This is basically what I believe which is that we have energy that is connected to our personality's and that she stole my personality. I know that it's weird but I don't know if I'm crazy or right. The only thought that comforts me is the idea of either returning to my previous self or dying. I don't what's real anymore and I'm an awful person. I no longer no right from wrong or good from bad. I used to be told that I was an incredibly mature child when I was very young and I was told that I was really smart and nice. Even being told by a few different that I'd be the new Einstein. Now I'm none of these things. I used to be s passionate about math, science, engineering, puzzles, critical thinking, mystery, and so much more. But now that's all gone. I feel nothing and can barely even think before I speak. I'm not good at anything that I was good at and now I'm a judgmental douche-bag. I keep think about how I may never be the same.

It's been made abundantly clear to me that my depression is an inconvenience to those around me, and (with two notable exceptions) everyone around me is only interested in what I can do for them. I have tried multiple times to get the help and support I feel I need, but it's either too expensive, or has been otherwise made unavailable to me (rent, food, or therapy: pick two). Any free resources require me to take time away from my work, which I can't do without either losing wages or my job.

I have tried reaching out to friends and family. At best they say ""man up and deal with it"". I've tried looking online for help and have been ignored. (I'm expecting this post to be downvoted to oblivion as well.)

So, I give up. It has been made apparent by an overwhelming majority that I am only liked insofar as I can make others happy. Failing that, I am useless.

203157,"Advice about girls, from a girl Imma talk about the sexual side of things but also some other things. keep in mind this does not fit to every girl out there to a T but it is useful info either way (btw I might get graphic so if that offends you or you’re under the age of 14. Maybe don’t read this)

- when hooking up, please understand that FOREPLAY MATTERS WE NEED MORE FOREPLAY. Foreplay is anything you do before sex, like oral and touching. Girls need to be turned on in order for sex to actually feel good. p l e a s e, foreplay

- Be safe. Use a condom. Don’t ever think you don’t need one unless you’re ready to have a child and deal with the consequences. 

- Use lube, it’s not that expensive and it can make sex feel better for us. 

- Find. The. Clitoris. It’s not that hard to find and has double the nerve endings of your tip. When you do find it. Be gentle with it, it can be very sensitive and if you’re too rough it can hurt for d a y s.

- If hooking up with someone new, ask what feels good, talk through it because if there’s communication there’s, not only, less confusion on consent. But being able to communicate what feels good makes for a better experience 

- this is so important if you only listen to one thing listen to this. DO NOT BE A HEAD PUSHER, DO NOT PUSH DOWN ON HER HEAD IF SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO GO DOWN ON YOU. Look I know it probably feels good and if you want her to change it up ask her to do something else. Oral on a male body is hard! If you forcefully push our head down it makes us choke and gag and for the most part, that doesn’t feel good. Generally speaking if you gag too much you could throw up. You want that throw up on you? No? Didn’t think so.

-if you aren’t gonna shave, don’t expect us to. The reason we have hair on certain areas on our body is to keep things protected and clean, nose hair keeps icky things out of your nose, eyelashes keep dirt out of your eyes, pubic hair for both of the sexes helps keep you clean and for female bodies it also helps with lubrication down there.

- both guys and girls think that the other is “bad at texting” when that’s just not true. As of right now I’m talking to a guy I met through APEX, we talk every day for hours on end. Don’t just message someone “hey” that’s lame and will lead to bad convo. Ask questions, ask about things they like and talk about things you like. Just like. Talk about things instead of saying things.

- don’t send dick pics. Just, don’t. Unless we ask specifically, don’t send it. 

- if we hookup with you, that doesn’t always mean we want to be in a relationship. Girls get horny too y’all sometimes we just wanna frick once and be on our way

- going off the last one. Don’t call us sluts or whores, like, ever? Saying “she belong to the streets” or being upset over a body count is rude. Over the years it’s finally becoming more and more acceptable for us to explore our sexuality. These are the years of our life when we’re all the most horny. Girls are always put down for exploring what we like and knowing what we like, don’t do that.

- GIRLS DONT LOOK LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE, WE DONT ACT LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE. Not every girl is a pornstar, everything you see in those videos is fake (extra tip, don’t support Pornhub. It’s a horrible company, there’s tons of free sites out there)

203191,"My heart won't let me make my husband into a single parent, but every other atom in my body wants to end it all.I never ever thought I would get to the point where I would post here. :/ Sorry for the novel in advance, but I feel like this is the only place I can let all of this out.

I have diagnosed anxiety issues, agoraphobia, schizoaffective disorder, and a slurry of other ""physical"" ailments. Nothing terminal, just really inconvenient and requiring me to be on a lot of medication and needing a cane/walker on my ""bad"" days. I'm only 29.

I am a stay-at-home mom who watches a 3-year-old literally 24/7. My husband works 60+ hours a week and maybe sees our child an hour a day at MAX. He drives our only vehicle, leaving me stranded at home with no access to an escape. We were technically homeless for a few months (stayed with friends), and moved to a really sketchy part of a nearby city because that was all we could afford, and I don't feel safe living here let alone going on a walk with our daughter outside to get some fresh air.

Things are going to get better. Relatively soon. But I don't think I'm going to make it that long.

I spend all day crying because I just... can't live like this. I don't see any other adults anymore, I barely talk to my friends (they all work obnoxious hours), and I sometimes see my husband just long enough to give him a hug and share a late supper with him. I love my daughter to pieces but raising her essentially alone is driving me absolutely INSANE. I don't get time away from her unless I am at a doctor's appointment. In the last 6 months, I got an hour away from her to go grocery shopping. I need a damn break, but I don't have the means.

I stopped taking my cocktail of medication because it was making me sleep literally 18 hours a day, which isn't a good thing when you have a child relying on you. I am down to taking only my fibromyalgia and blood pressure medication- 2 of my 11 prescriptions. I stopped seeing my shrink (wasn't helping), stopped going to my psych (too tired for followup), and stopped seeing all of my other specialists. I disabled my Facebook and my messenger because I couldn't handle the interaction with people. I stopped answering phone calls and texts. I basically fell off the face of the planet to everyone that I don't live with.

I just want all of this to end. My poor husband is to the point where his work is being affected because he is so worried he is going to come home to find me dead. I promised him I would never kill myself when kiddo is around because me being gone would already scar her- she doesn't need to see me dead too. I think saying that has caused me to be perma-stuck watching kiddo, because everyone knows I won't kill myself if I am stuck with her.

He has banned me from driving solo because I have tried to drive into a tree in the past. If I have access to the car, he makes sure I take kiddo with me because I would NEVER put her in danger.

I have a plan, I just don't have a window of time where I can do it because I am literally with my daughter nonstop. I have access to 4 months worth of my blood pressure medication that would surely kill me if taken all at once. I have been debating it for days.

Obviously, I need to be locked up and remedicated. I have been to the psych ward in the past, and even though they couldn't help me then (they said my suicidal thoughts were postpartum depression, so they didn't take it seriously) I am easily 20x worse mentally than I was before. There is no way for me to go and get the help I need because my husband works nonstop and we don't have any access to reliable child care for our daughter.

I promised my husband I would not make him a single parent. That I could never ever put him through that. But fuck... It is getting harder and harder to keep that promise.

I love him and my daughter so much. But I can't live like this anymore. It is killing me.",suicide

203198,"Reaching out is bullshitHow come everyone always says to reach out? Or afterwards they say oh, if only we'd known, if only they'd reached out for help. 

I called my parents tonight to say I felt low and was really struggling. Got told I'm an emotional bully and emotionally abusing them. Literally because I said being told to go for a walk and think of all the things I had to be grateful for was not helping, that I'd already tried every coping strategy I could think of. 

Texted a friend to say I'd had a hard week, could really do with a catch up and were we still on for X. Ignored. 

Looked through my phone book to see if there's anyone else. There isn't. Everyone in there has distanced themselves one way or another. Usually I just get ignored. 

I get that I'm a fucking miserable shit and no fun to be around sometimes (though tbh even on my good days people don't want me around). I get it. But it really isn't helpful when people pretend that reaching out makes it better. Because I keep reaching and everyone keeps running away. And then when I finally work up the courage to do it, they're all going to say afterwards, oh if only we'd known. 

You did know. Every fucking one of you knew. Even if I hadn't said it out loud (because who wants someone around who says shit like that), I've definitely said to all of them at one point that I was having a bad week and got nothing back. Even just hey, rough week at work, fancy a beer? Nothing. NOTHING. 

Even if I pretend for years that all is fine. As soon as I say my day hasn't been great, I get ignored or distanced. It's not like I say oh worst day ever, gonna top myself guys. Apparently just ""ah, bad day - can't wait for a beer"" is enough for these guys to drop me like a rotting potato. 

I think something went wrong when I was born. Biologically, something in me is repulsive. You can't fix shit like that. 

Anyway, that's not the point. The point is that telling everyone to reach out just makes it a hundred times worse when you try that and it doesn't work. And coming into this post and saying hey, this anon cares is hardly going to make up for the fact that real actual people who have actually met me have basically sent every sign they can to say they don't want me in their lives. And I get it. Cos I don't want me in my life either. But apparently I don't have much of a choice since I'm not fucking strong enough to end it. 

Fuck it. I don't actually know what to do. I'll work it out though. At least I don't have to worry about hurting anyone else now. I think the balance has tipped to where I don't give a damn about staying alive just to avoid hurting someone else. Cos it's hurting me more to live like this. ",suicide

It came out rushed and sounding like shit, and it doesn't at all well convey what's going on. But I so desperately need to talk about it that I decided fuck it and post anyways.

I used to tell myself that the reason I don't kill myself is because I love my family, but honestly I now think it's really that I'm scared of what will happen if someone catches me, that and I like my fantasies too much (sometimes I stupidly believe they have a chance of ever happening) and that I'm too tired to (I've already tried choking myself 4 times, once with my own hands, put a knife to my throat and would have hung myself in the tree in my backyard by now if I hadn't felt too shaky and dizzy to get to the upper branches).

The reasons I can't stand living are too long to list (I could probably write an entire book about it), and I've noticed many of the reasons are shared by people here, so I'll just summarize a small handful of reasons.

- My sister, who's four years younger than me, has a drivers license, a ton of friends (both irl and online) and has been with an incredibly loving and supporting boyfriend for three years that she just moved in with and I suspect she'll marry someday. Meanwhile I have no drivers license, no friends, I've never had a girlfriend, and I still live with our parents.

- When my anxiety gets too much I sometimes have seizure like fits. According to doctors they're not seizures, yet they never actually gave me a diagnosis for what they are (I suspect they might have thought I was faking). Despite the fact that they've witnessed it themselves and even got chewed out by my driver's ed instructor who witnessed one of these, my parents refuse to take it seriously. You can read more about it in this link below
https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/6lso8g/does_anyone_elses_anxiety_cause_seizurelike/
As if having anxiety and dizziness clog my mind wasn't embarrassing and hindered me enough in doing basic tasks that other people can do with ease. 

- I can't stand being around other people. Just being near people too long makes me fill with fear. Every moment I'm out in public is spent longing to be back in the comfort of my bedroom.

- I have no friends. Even setting aside my anxiety when around people, almost everyone is either a bigoted and willingly ignorant jerk to other people, or is too busy to be interested in being with me (or I'm too scared/tired to be with them). And the few who aren't are probably put off by everything about me.

- When I'm angry I have bizarre (seriously messed up) thoughts and sometimes uncontrollably mumble gibberish, make threats that make no sense or just weird unintelligible noises (this is the first time I've told ANYONE about this, but I suspect people have noticed despite my best efforts to hide it).

Again these aren't all the reasons (I'm too tired and shaky to write anymore, plus it would go on forever) but these are major reasons.
(I originally tried posting all of the above in the depression subreddit but messed up the title and after finding out I couldn't edit it, tried deleting everything and was unable to make a new one (before today I had only replied to other people's posts, never made one myself) and hadn't planned to post here. In hindsight, perhaps this subreddit is more appropriate, especially given what I just tried doing a couple minutes ago).

I weighed 138lbs two weeks ago and today I weighed 121 when I stepped on the scale (which is a lot when you’re only 5’1) I currently live in a state where I have no family and friends. Honestly, I don’t really have friends out of stats either. 

None of this is an exaggeration or me not thinking clearly. If I died in this apartment, *no one would ever find me.* It’d probably take months before someone realized I was gone. Since I’m in the dissertation phase of my PhD, I don’t have classes. I write it independently. Which is another reason why no one would notice if I died. On the bright side, at least no one would be hurt if I died. Sure, there’d be social media posts written by people who haven’t spoken to me in years, but that’s about it. 

Over the past 2 weeks, I’ve called and txted just about every “friend” I thought I had. No one answered. No one texted back.

The thought that I was hurt in this way as a child definitely hurt me. I found this information out at a young age too, so not good. I never really faced the truth of accepting this as something that happened to me and never really talked to anyone about how it made me feel. I lived my life in this anxiety/depressed ridden bubble, also had a couple of traumatic things happen since but not near as bad.

I was going to tell my bf about what I wanted to talk to my therapist about, the sexual assault. I immediately fell into the attack and completely disassociated. I felt like I had no control over what I was saying or thinking and I remember telling my bf some disturbing things that were very detailed but it all felt like a dream. In this state, I remember either thinking or saying (I can’t tell you which my thoughts felt LOUD) the only way out of this dream is to kill myself and then thinking or saying how I didn’t want to because I was happy now and of course crying hysterically. 

My bf put me to bed and I woke up to him looking at me very worried. I couldn’t remember a lot and it all felt like a dream. He wouldn’t disclose details to me about what I said and I didn’t press because I vaguely could recall some of it and it was awful. I could tell whatever I said really hurt him because he was on the verge of tears.

I have been since I started college and it's been the only way that I could have found the means to do all the things that I wanted.

However it wasn't enough to cover bills that started popping up like a medical bill that my mom never paid for that collectors were calling non-stop about.

Life is a cruel world we’re just existing not living no more. I go on my day just existing ive lost total motivation for everything. I know I need help but how to ask for it? One may never find the correct answer. Where is my mind? I’m just existing not living. As a kid I had such big dreams now I realize my dreams were too big. People aren’t the same anymore. Society hates everyone. Especially people like me, this world isn’t meant for people like me. I wanna start living instead of existing but the days seem so long and bland, that I just see the days go by and everyone doing so much, yet I’m in a sort of trance where I just see everything happening slowly. I’m sick of being so sad all the time. If I were to die, I wish I could’ve been the person I so much everyone thought I was. I’m a fake. I’m not who I portray to be, I’m sad, hopeless, unhappy, dead. All of the above I’m not who I wish I was. I’m trying but you can only try so hard. Whatever we do in life will ultimately be insignificant but it’s important that we do what we wanna do because no one else will.

203258,"My Psychiatrist told me that there is nothing else that can be done.I have been seeing the same Psychiatrist for several years, and have been trying to treat anxiety, depression, and PTSD related to abuse I faced as a teen. I have been hospitalized several times, and have been on countless pills. Yoga, acupuncture, diets, group therapy, a case worker. Most antidepressants didn't work well for me, one putting me in hospital after I had some really dangerous mental issues. I also receive ECT every 2 weeks.

A few months ago I requested a visit to a sleep clinic to deal with my nightmares. My psychiatrist refused at first, saying it would be a waste. I did get the referral and they found a sleep disorder and requested I work with a sleep therapist. The sleep therapist requested I see a mental health therapist one to one as well, as I am a bit of a mess. I completed a round of CBT, improving my sleep, which helps the depression.

So I go to my Psychiatrist for the therapy referral and he tells me that there are no therapists, that there is no longer treatment for me, and that this would be our final appointment. It has been a few weeks, I have an appointment for a second opinion set up in July, but I am also sinking in mood. If nothing can be done, why continue suffering? It is cruel to make me hold out in this pain for no reason. I want a happy, successful life, but if my psychiatrist is saying that wouldn't be possible, should I really put myself through decades of suffering for no real reason? It has been 15 years since my diagnosis of mental health issues, and no success. I am really worn down from it.",suicide
203259,"A friend of mine tried to commit suicide yesterday.And I need your advice. A little more background info: Yesterday, my ex-girlfriend, which I'm still very close to, called me. She told me that our friend, let's call him Leon, just tried to kill himself. But he failed.
Leon has been my friend for about 12 years now, he is my best friend. We can talk to each other about love, sex and stuff (We're both 18), but instead of talking to me about his suicidal thoughts, he talked to my ex-gf. She has been the supportive person that is mentioned in the guideline of /r/swrecources He did not want to worry me.
But whatever. I instantly called Leon on Skype after hearing about this, and talked to him. Tried to make him stop. But I had no chance. Litterally Zero. It seems like there is nothing I can do. Leon doesn't want me to tell other people about his suicide attempt. 

But I can't sit around waiting for him to kill himself. And at this point, I don't care anymore about what he thinks about me. I want to save him. I love him too much. But should I respect him and not tell anyone about it, or should I make the first move to inform people, who can probably stop him from killing himself? (Like his brother?)

I arranged a meeting with Leon today, to get him busy so he can't try it another time. 
I hope Leon shows up, it is a shitty feeling to wake up and not to know whether your best friend is still alive or not.",suicide

My dad was one of the many who pre-ordered cyberpunk 2077 (still loved it). However, he pre-ordered it from Amazon, and apparently the physical copy had some kind of deal with warner bros and came with a free month of hbo max. At first I didn't think much of it, until I saw that all of my childhood shows were on there. Chowder, amazing world of gumball, all the studio ghibli movies. I was excited. To make the most of my time, I started watching regular and adventure time at the same time because I didn't know how long we were gonna have it. But then I decided to add Steve universe to the mix because the same reason. And that show, just stuck with me. Man was it something different. I watched over the course of like a month and it was pretty much an masterpiece. Afterwards I watched the movie and it was only okay. But then I saw Steve universe future, and man was it also amazing. But yesterday I finished it, and now I don't know what to do with my life.

203279,"I don’t think we should be hereI don’t think this subreddit should exist.

There, I said it.

This sub is named “SuicideWatch”. This name is a blatant miscommunication. Suicide watch is an organisation dedicated to making sure that people **won’t** kill themselves. This subreddit, however, almost seems to encourage it.

The problem with this sub is that it consists mainly of suicidal people with hopeless thoughts. When someone posts about being suicidal, the responses are usually about other people who are also suicidal. And this leads to the suicidal feelings of both the poster and the replier to be reinforced.

And however fucking awful life may be, we have to at least **try** to keep on living.

I get it, life sucks. I’m suicidal myself, and it sucks for me too. But the point is that we have to keep believing that it can get better. No matter how bad it is right now. Even if those beliefs are lies.

If you have terrible family members or you have no friends, you can always outgrow your family, and you never know when or how you can get thrust into social situations.

If you’re tired of your job or your life and everything is monotonous, try something new, or find a way forward. And go to a psychiatrist because these things usually have something to do with underlying mental illnesses. 

If you have some kind of hopeless medical condition that can’t be cured, medical science is advancing all the time, who knows what the future will bring?

And maybe things won’t get better, and maybe you can never be happy and if so, then so be it.

But you have to at least **try** to believe that you can be.

Because what if next year will be the best year of your life? What if everything fixes itself and everything works out for the best eventually? Then you’ll be missing out on **so much** of a life you never had.

And I don’t think this sub encourages this thinking.

I think this subreddit will eventually be discovered and uncovered for what it really is. The mainstream media will call it an atrocity, and Reddit will be pressured into shutting it all down. 

And I think that’s a good thing.

If you want an alternative to just get your feelings on the internet that is much better than this one, I’d recommend the forum suicideforum.com. It has some genuinely wonderful people and some of them seem to know what they’re doing.

Above all, keep hoping. Maybe it can get better. You never know.",suicide

i enjoy it because sex is when i am closest to being dead. i am extremely submissive. the more someone can control, subjugate and use me, the more they can beat me down so i am completely helpless, so i need never make any choices, so everything is in their hands -- the more i get off.

life is making choices. i get off on being mentally dead and crippled.

life is having values, and working to achieve those values. a cowardly simulacrum of the void is not a value, not something to live for.

i have long felt that nothing seems real or meaningful. that is because i cannot evaluate anything as positive for me. i do not enjoy doing anything. i do not even experience the basic human pleasure of looking at something that i made and knowing that i made it.

December was when I met the love of my life who has since left me, since then I just can’t get excited about anything to do with the holiday season. Worse I can’t even mourn it with support because my parents don’t know she’s trans (she identified as a boy 3 quarters of the time we were together, obviously I had no problem with her wanting to be her authentic self and loved her nonetheless) and they’re mega transphobes but I refuse to deadname her or use improper pronouns so I just can’t even talk about how much I miss her and how everyday is a struggle without her. 

They also are major homophobes and being bi their comments hurt more than they think. Plus with the stupid pandemic we can’t even do what we normally do which is visit my dads side who I love to visit. 

This season and day approaching hold no joy for me instead it holds dread. Everyday gets colder and I feel worse and worse.

Long term loneliness (6 years and counting)

Have a mental condition which impairs my social skills, hidden for the most part, but people see me as a bad kind of weird as a result.

Thing's that I'm passionate about are not popular for normal conversation (gaming, tech, psychology) so avoid at all costs.

These combined factors leave me socially crippled and unable to adapt.

See brother who has similar upbringing (minus mental condition) flourishing, decent size group of friends,popular at work and has no trouble with women (romantically)

See people from high school constantly taking photo's of themselves going on nights out with friends, enjoying being in a relationship, on holiday etc etc

I always thought that If I helped people, try to stay on their good side, try to help them at any opportunity whenever they needed it that maybe I could start a small group of friends and be able to live and do things people my age always do. That decision was clearly the wrong choice.

So here I am after 6 years, wake up, go to work, play video games, sleep, repeat.

I've exhausted all my options, there are no local social clubs nearby, tried looking on websites intended for the same thing but ended up empty, parents say why not try online dating but again socially crippled so no chance of me getting anywhere when I can't start/hold a conversation as a man.

Tried a holiday firm that groups a number of people in the same age group to go on an adventure type holiday, felt much better thanks to my room mate being such a great lad but its far too expensive to do more than once every couple of years and only for 1 week at that.

Not prepared to live the rest of my life like this, no rational reason to keep going as thing's clearly dont change, already planned ahead for location and method just a few things left to tie up.

I don't want to die, but I don't want to continue living like this either, I hoping someone can see something I can't because from where I'm standing I have two options, I can take the quick way out now or, I wait and suffer in silence till depression cripples me to such a degree that it begins to affect my job and family.

My life has always kinda sucked, not that it was too bad tho. People have it immensly worse then me so I really have nothing to complain about. I always had a roof on my head, a family and all that. 

But I was always the weird kid. I never fit in, I was overly emotional and loud and the odd one out. Of course I was an easy target for bullying. But that was life everyone told me high school would be better.

Of course high school was mostly more of the same except for the fact that I found some ""friends"". I say this in quotes because I was never truly apart of the group. Unless I planned something I wasn't invited, I was always forgotten about and just left out. 

In my senior year I got really close to some people in my group of friends and even though it was some of the best days of my life it was also some of the most toxic. We just encouraged each other's depressed feelings and made each other feel worse. I never told any of them about my suicide attempt during that time. It was the attempt that made me rethink my life and try to turn it around.

I was happier, a bit better and finding things I liked. Of course I was lonlier then I've ever been but I was confident in myself and okay with the person I am. I started to come on here a lot to try to help people out, wanting them to feel better. It made me feel like I had a purpose, even if it may have been insignificant 

Now I'm just in a complete spiral of depression. I'm over life I'm done with it. I have no future I have no one I have nothing. I just feel like sitting down writing a long note and ending it :(

203367,"I find myself at a loss.I suppose it's important to note that both of my parents are diagnosed bipolar, my mother (to my memory) has attempted suicide two or three times, and my dad probably countless. 

Since I've been out of high school I've found it very hard to make and keep friends. I enjoy being around people very much but for the most part I feel like I'm being annoying if I try to text them too often or whatever. I figure if they arn't interested in me enough, then I guess they really shouldn't be my friend, right?

Well, my boyfriend and I broke up three weeks ago. His name is Ryan. I was absolutely devastated. I was very committed to him and I loved him very much, but a few months before it had seemed he went through a change, he wasn't as passionate about me anymore, it left me feeling very unwanted. It's so hard to watch your best friend, the person you think you're going to spend the rest of your left with do a complete 180. It was so sudden, I thought it was a phase. His mom and just gotten remarried and his grandmother had just died I thought he was just going through some things. Things didn't get better, one drunken night with our friends we all talked about what was going on and I cried to him and he said he would work on it. Things got better for a while... but three weeks ago I just broke down and had a fit mourning the man I feel in love with. That night I tried to talk to him about things we could do to make our relationship better. At that point we were working together so I asked if we could switch shifts or maybe I get another job. I had been wanting a new one anyway. For all I've been told and know he was in love with me and hadn't had a thought about leaving me before, but on that night he decided that it would be best for me if he left. I tried to talk him out of it, but he said he was tired of hurting me and he wanted me to be happy.

At that point in my life there were only 3 people I would really consider to be my friends. Ryan, our mutual friend Steve and another of our coworkers Amanda. Ryan left and went to Steve's house while I desperately tried to find someone to talk to. There was no one. In my darkest hour I had no one to be there for me. I spend the night having a crying fit every half an hour. I finally fell asleep for only 4 hours and woke up by jumping out of my bed and pacing around my house crying.  

Ryan has been staying on Steve's couch.

The first week was hard, but I tried to put myself out there and spend as little time at home as I could.

The second week was far far better and I almost started to feel a little like myself again. 

This third week it's begun. Since Ryan and Steve have been living together they're always together and I always hear at work about the parties they had or whatever... While I'm alone. Since the break up no one from work has invited me anywhere, I was actually pretty crushed when Ryan told me that Amanda and her friend had invited them out to lunch one time. I feels like everyone had chosen him over me. i side in my house going crazier and crazier. 

It's almost like there are two mes right now. It seems... to come in waves. Like I'll feel almost normal again... and then something will happen and I'll just feel like a worthless mess. That I'm burdening everyone and my life would be better off not existing. I'm so nice I want to fucking kill myself. It's pathetic.

In these episodes I contemplate suicide a lot. I make plans and even think of notes to go along with it. The hardest part is that the only one I have to talk to is Ryan. Steven says I keep saying stupid stuff and I just end up making Amanda very uncomfortable. Ryan says he wants to be my friend and that I'm not burdening him. He doesn't like when I talk about killing myself and he'd much rather me alive. Usually when I have these thoughts I talk to him and by the time we're done I feel much better.

To be honest, I truly truly do not want to die. 

I just dont want to live in constant pain anymore, and I'm afraid that the next episode I won't manage to shake it off before I do something drastic. 

I feel like I dont fit in at work anymore, everyone says I'm cool but no one seems to be interested in me. No one texts or calls me, while Ryan seems ever popular. This was an issue even when I was with him and has only been exacerbated since our break up. I think it's one of the things that led to our break up...",suicide

203396,"dark memories never fadeI feel like im at the end of the road this last week, I have a lot of secrets I haven't told anyone and I have a really dark secret I've told two people. I'll start off by saying that I told my best friend and brother (at separate times) that I was raped by one of my brothers friends when I was 6 and he was 13. My best friends response was kind of just that I should tell my brother and that I dont need therapy because I seem okay, my brothers response was that I just shouldnt let this define me as a person and he kept asking me questions that made me feel like he thought I was lying about it and he also told me to get therapy. The other thing traumatic that happened was me being on a hardcore meth binge in 2012, I was only 16 at the time and I cant even remember the first time I did it, I remember staying up for 80 hours at a time and crawling on the ground with flashlights looking for leftover crystals to smoke and stealing from my neighbors and friends to fuel this addiction, I'm thankful that I was able to stop after a month or so but the way it stopped wasn't exactly pleasant. The main person I used to tweak out with was a friend and after a month of hardcore meth binging he wanted to move in with me and my parents and start selling it out of my house, I told him we cant do that because I dont want my family involved and that same weekend he came to my house with a strange dude and a gun and asked me ""Are your parents awake?"" I told him they weren't and he asked ""Do they have a gun?"" I responded that they do have a gun and his final response before SPRINTING out of my room at full speed and ransacking my house was ""Well they better not wake up because if they do; I'll kill them"" They didn't kill my parents and they were later arrested and served 3 months (thanks california) Other reasons that have pushed me to this point are the fact that my parents 100% did not want me to be born, my brother is 30, my sister is 33 and I am 22, they were supposed to be done having kids before my mother got pregnant with me. That basically meant that I received little to no attention from my parents, my father worked a night shift and slept all day so I've never really had a conversation with him nor can I because he speaks primarily spanish and can hardly speak english and I never learned spanish because I was never around him. Both my parents are good people but they got themselves in a ton of debt in between my siblings being born and me being born, this meant that they withdrew all their retirement funds to put my sister through college and bought her a car, she totaled that car and they bought her a new one, she also totaled that one and they helped her buy another one. They bought my brother two cars and helped co sign his last car he bought 6 years ago, the only time my parents have offered to help me was when they tried getting me to help buy THEM a car in their names and they would let me drive it, I don't live with them anymore but I still have to send them money monthly to help them with expenses since they are very old and my father is retired and my mom got fired from her job that paid well in 2014 and she settled for a job she is 200% over qualified for, she has a masters degree in business management and gets paid 14 dollars and hour and every time I tell her shes better than that she just shrugs me off and tells me thats the job she wants to retire from, I dont have any resent towards my parents, I have resent towards myself for even being born in the first place, everytime i look in the mirror I see a disgusting human being who deserves the worst in life, when I take my clothes off it is amplified by my disgusting body hair that has been the main subject for many people being grossed out or insulting me. I am so fucking tired of everything and two days ago I basically just ragequit my whole friend circle because they keep fucking ditching me, i told them it bothers me when they ditch me and they basically just laughed it off. What is the point of continuing?

So I went into the shower, put on some chill music, and sat there for a long, long time. Long enough for the water to get freezing cold. I used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there, staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin. When I finally got out, I put on my dirty ass pajamas I’d been wearing for a week, and went into my room. I tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop. As I felt the belt tightening around my neck, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I freaked the fuck out. I immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck. I couldn’t get it back over my head and I was hyperventilating. When I finally got it off, I was just shaking like a leaf. I sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time. I ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened, and they came into my room, took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug. But now, I’m sitting here, in my school parking lot, avoiding going to class, and I’m regretting calling her at all. I wish I had just waited until I calmed down enough to try again. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be alive. And now I’m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else. I fucking hate this. I just want to drive my car off of a bridge. I can’t do this anymore. Maybe when I go home I’ll gather all the pills I can find and try again. I can’t go into school. I can’t face the fucktards I call ‘friends’. I can’t face the people who were supposed to be there for me. I just want to go home. Not back to my house. Back to where I came from. I want to go back to the earth.

I have been working through all this in therapy, but I honestly think that everyone... Every single human who has ever existed, is selfish and ONLY does things that are self serving. We expect something back, even if you don't realize it. Sometimes you are making an ""investment"" into a relationship with someone, and expect to be able to gain something in the future.

This idea in my head has taken strong roots and is starting to shape my life... And I am finding it much harder to resist the urge to self harm... Or just do the big one. I am laying in bed now, craving to cut... But I haven't... Yet, at least.

203444,"Therapy just makes me feel stupidIn December of last year I think, I got a new GP since I needed someone to prescribe me my hormones. I wanted to discuss getting a new antidepressant as well, so she referred me to a psychiatrist.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to the psychiatrist in January and, like an idiot, I mentioned my plan to kill myself the summer of that year, which resulted in me being handcuffed and dragged to Emergency Psychological Services, where I was repeatedly misgendered by staff when I wasn't being totally ignored, the only vegetarian options for dinner were bread and carrots, and I was just generally made to feel broken and subhuman. I was let out 24 hours later when I said I didn't plan to kill myself in the immediate future, which is something I had never planned to do in the first place. What I learned was that if I was honest about the severity of my suicidal thoughts, I would be punished.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I went shopping for a therapist, but none of the ones who seemed like a good fit were covered by my insurance. So eventually the hospital set me up with a psychologist. Our first meeting, she asked me what aspects of my body made me dysphoric and then laughed at me when I included my feet on the list. That same meeting, after I expressed concerns that if I scheduled a vaginoplasty, my insurance would change before I reached the scheduled date and I would no longer have any hope of affording it, she told me it would be possible to get the surgery within a year, which was a bold-faced lie since even the required electrolysis in preparation takes at least a year, and she would know this since she also works at the gender health clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

Every subsequent meeting has involved her trying to get me to talk about my self-loathing and hopelessness and then telling me I'm being irrational the moment I even begin to articulate anything. This is apparently what cognitive behavioral therapy is. When I tell her this all makes me feel stupid, she retorts that that too is irrational since even though I've never had my IQ tested, it's probably fairly high according to her magical powers of psychometric clairvoyance. In other words, I'm stupid for feeling stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

And now my homework is to imagine a set of life circumstances which will make me happy and which I can realistically achieve, which I'm too stupid to do. I've ruined some of the most important friendships in my life along with the only romantic relationship I've ever had with my incessant self-loathing ramblings, and that whole episode of my life ended with me being told to get therapy, yet apparently, I'm too stupid for therapy to even work at all. The only solution I can see is to kill myself, but I can't tell any mental health professional how badly I want to or I'll be sent to Crazy People Jail again.

203462,"Study shows that too much hw is harmful. Spread the word. A Stanford researcher found that students in high-achieving communities who spend too much time on homework experience more stress, physical health problems, a lack of balance and even alienation from society. More than two hours of homework a night may be counterproductive, according to the study.


Pope and her colleagues found that too much homework can diminish its effectiveness and even be counterproductive. They cite prior research indicating that homework benefits plateau at about two hours per night, and that 90 minutes to two and a half hours is optimal for high school.


Their study found that too much homework is associated with:


• Greater stress: 56 percent of the students considered homework a primary source of stress, according to the survey data. Forty-three percent viewed tests as a primary stressor, while 33 percent put the pressure to get good grades in that category. Less than 1 percent of the students said homework was not a stressor.


• Reductions in health: In their open-ended answers, many students said their homework load led to sleep deprivation and other health problems. The researchers asked students whether they experienced health issues such as headaches, exhaustion, sleep deprivation, weight loss and stomach problems.


• Less time for friends, family and extracurricular pursuits: Both the survey data and student responses indicate that spending too much time on homework meant that students were “not meeting their developmental needs or cultivating other critical life skills,” according to the researchers. Students were more likely to drop activities, not see friends or family, and not pursue hobbies they enjoy.




The results offer empirical evidence that many students struggle to find balance between homework, extracurricular activities and social time, the researchers said. Many students felt forced or obligated to choose homework over developing other talents or skills.


Also, there was no relationship between the time spent on homework and how much the student enjoyed it. The research quoted students as saying they often do homework they see as “pointless” or “mindless” in order to keep their grades up.


“This kind of busy work, by its very nature, discourages learning and instead promotes doing homework simply to get points,” Pope said.



She said the research calls into question the value of assigning large amounts of homework in high-performing schools. Homework should not be simply assigned as a routine practice, she said.


“Rather, any homework assigned should have a purpose and benefit, and it should be designed to cultivate learning and development,” wrote Pope.



TL;DR : study shows that over 2 hours of hw can negatively effect student. Hw should only be assigned to benefit the students and  should not be assigned as a regular practice. Too much hw can lead students to become sleep deprived, isolated, and stressed.",non-suicide

So I'm completely broke. Getting hospitalized is expensive and I'm over $3000 dollars in medical debt. My health insurance with work is shit, and nearly covered nothing. I was relying on my friends who said that they would financial support me if I just finally got some help. So that was a lie. I'm two months behind on rent and utilities and my landlord is getting frustrated with me. Maybe because I been two months behind since last year.

I've become unemployable. I used to work two jobs to make due. Full time at a hotel and part time delivery. I lost my delivery job after having a meltdown at work. I still work at the hotel but my hours been cut to two or three days a week (16-24 hours a week) because I visibly cannot handle the stress. It's gotten so bad customers are writing negative reviews about the ""nutcase behind the front desk"". I tried applying for other jobs but I turned into jibbering wrecks during all the interviews. 

I stayed with the medical treatments for seven months. I was on 3 different medications (the names of which I have no idea how to spell. And all attempts to goggle them have failed) so they stopped working really early on. I spent nearly all 7 months begging my doctor to change my proscription because I was becoming unhinged and more unstable. He refused, insisting upping the dosage will work. It didn't. I tried finding a new doctor. They insisted on trying the same medication so I refused. The therapy failed to do anything. I been in therapy since I was 15 and it never helped. 

I have no family, no romantic partner, and very few friends left as nobody is willing to watch me self destruct anymore. I've become a burden financially and emotionally on everyone I care about. As a result everyone is now cutting me out of their lives because I can't contribute anything to the relationship, I can only take.

I gone the last five years with absolutely nothing to live for. The only thing stopping me from trying to kill myself again at this point is ""what happens if I fail to kill myself AGAIN"" 

Wtf am I supposed to do at this point?",suicide

I’ve been struggling a lot recently. A lot of stress and anxiety, and I’ve been struggling to sleep properly. 

I haven’t been able to sleep tonight. I guess my mind is just too busy. I hate that feeling. 

Anyway, I’ve been trying not to overdo it with the alcohol. I’ve been using fairly often recently to help with the anxiety and such, and it can help me sleep. 

I just had a bit to drink and it’s hit me pretty hard. A bit harder than I was expecting. It’s not too bad, I just... I wish I didn’t have to resort to these things to function properly. I took one of my Diazepam aswell. 

I’m not sure why I’m writing this. It’s possible I’ll forget that I’ve done so. 

The last time I got drunk, I ended up throwing up everything and feeling really sick. I ended up spending the night at my parents. I should be okay now though. It’s not that bad. It’s just... I don’t know. 

I don’t like not being able to sleep. I don’t like the restlessness. 

I’ve had a lot of stressed lately. I don’t like how alcohol has become a coping mechanism for me, but it has. Hopefully I will be able to get to sleep without the stomach pains and the vomiting that often results from my drinking.

203485,"I have cancer and my life is constantly getting worseHi everyone, I just discovered this subreddit seeking for help, here's my story. When I was fifteen years old, I tore my groin playing basketball. About eight months later I was having constant pain throughout my whole left thigh after my games, to the point of bringing me tears. So my family decided that we'd go and get another MRI, except this time we found a malignant tumor spanning from the top of my pelvis to about halfway down my femur. This tumor was so large that it was coming up and hitting my sciatic nerve which was causing my terrible pain. The very first thing after this was obviously to have a whole body MRI, where we found that I also had eighteen cancerous nodules throughout my lungs. After my biopsy I was told that I had a very, very rare form of cancer; mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Only one hundred cases of this disease are diagnosed per year, and they were unsure of how to treat me, and gave me five months to live. I am a very strong-willed, stable, rational, and science-based thinker. The appointment I was diagnosed I told my physician that if removing my whole left leg is what meant keeping me alive, it's what I would do. So time goes on, I am given eight months of treatment including the most harsh form of chemotherapy and radiation, on top of lung surgeries. At this time, me and a girl had mutually fallen in love, we were both with each other almost every day, as I invested all my time into her knowing that any day could be my last day. She was my first love. Time goes on as I have a lung tube and my first lung surgery removing the bottom half of my left lung and taking three tumors with it. I was then told by this girl that she had met someone while on a cruise ship who went to a school near by, and she no longer cared about me. This destroyed me as I had given what I thought was my last bit of love to the wrong person the whole time, I couldn't even fathom what had happened and thought she'd come back. I'd try getting to her, but to no luck I'd get nothing. I was left in a hospital rotting away by myself, as my skin was due to radiation. I sort of got over it. Come to the end of my treatments, I found out I was only left with eight tumors in my lungs which we thought were dormant and we had found that my hip tumor had been killed. I was waiting to go back to school with all my friends, not to mention all the support from all the people from around my city. I had gotten to meet so many people as I was a very social person which helped a lot. After this my parents had told me that they were getting divorced and my mom was soon moved out, to a job where she still to this day lives pay-check to pay-check. My dad then tells me that I am moving away to another city forty minutes away to move in with his new girlfriend. He knew that I had so longed to go back to school with all of my peers, but this didn't matter apparently. I had considered moving in with my mom to stay close to everyone, but my medical bills which exceeded $400,000 would financially ruin her. So I stayed with my dad who promised to get me a car. Four months go by, and after more screenings I discover I now have twelve tumors, and might have to have a hip replacement that will end my basketball and put me in a wheelchair by the time I'm forty, five. I'm not even expected to live past forty five as the recurrence rate for my cancer is 90% on tops of a 10% chance of survival. Mad is in the military and my now step-mom is a trauma nurse in an ICU so my life is very strict and in-line. I constantly get yelled at for things other parents would not raise a finger at. I am at a new school as a senior  with no friends. I have no way of seeing my friends except when I go to my mom's who only gets to see me every other weekend, and when I'm over I want to see my friends, meaning I hardly even see my struggling mom. My thick, long hair has grown back very thin and with a receding hairline. I have no car, meaning I can't see my family or friends when I want. I have no confidence talking to girls due to my hair and that I feel as if I'm a broken version of my old self, and having a car doesn't help. I am grounded and yelled at all the time, I have had my phone and Xbox taken for three weeks right now for ""working out when I was supposed to be in bed"" and the only way I have contact to my friends is over my laptop, which isn't very reliant. I have no money, because I can't drive to get a job and my dad gives me none. I got behind on my schoolwork, my grades dropped, along with my GPA. I wasn't given time to study for my ACT and SAT which I just took in a hurry to meet college deadlines if I even get lucky enough to get in. My sole purpose in life in my opinion is to help people, I want to spread my word, impact and save lives, and use what I have for good. But my depression and suicidal thoughts are holding me back. Why would I stress through eight to twelve years to go through the stressful task of med school if I could die any day now? Do I even have a purpose?  I kept my strong mentality and I became content with the idea of death since I had accepted what I had, knowing it’s what God had planned for me. I was and I still am happy with the fact that I’ve been able to impact other peoples lives with my story and the way in which I have lived by never letting my problems get to me and continuing to be optimistic and disciplined. But now it has almost been three years since my diagnoses, and things in my life have gotten either worse or have been at a constant state of being in mental and physical pain. I wake up and breathe and my lungs ache, I walk downstairs to get ready for whatever I’m doing that day and I can feel my femur scrape against the inside of my hip socket, and I look in the mirror in the bathroom to get ready and look at my hair and am reminded that I’ll never look the same as I used to. All this combined makes me feel like a shell and a broken version of the person I used to be. I can’t even build the confidence to talk to girls because I’m constantly worried about how I look, or that I don’t feel as if I’m good enough for them, or that I’d be a waste of their time since I could literally die at any given time, and I can’t stand this because I have all of this love and no one to give it to, I wish I had someone to take the weight I have off of my shoulders and someone to treat right and talk to. This all adds to my school stress, my mom not living a quality life, and my dad treating me like I’m ten. I have to admit that this positive and optimistic mind that I have is not mixing well with the idea that I’m comfortable and accepting of death. These past couple of weeks my constant pain, depression, and lack of confidence have made me question if anything will ever get better, because nothing has. I’ve started thinking more about death, even to the point of having calm dreams about it, and I’m scared.

203486,"directionless, hurt and unsure anymoreSo im a 19 soon to be 20 male studying law atm. My room is a mess,  i have no direction, my gramps is constantly berating me and make me feel like a piece of sht just because i am forgetful and how i'll never be a lawyer at this rate (i lost my keys several times already and my phone before). Sometimes, salesman would go through our front gate to reach our home door and knock. This made my gramps paranoid and tells me to lock the front gate everytime i come home. Sometimes, i forget and he yells at me and with strong words reminds me of the importance of locking the gate and safety. My little sis also lives 2 min walk away from the school and gramps would tell me to take her to school. Today, she just went by herself and me thinking it would be alright, since i had to walk 20mins to school everyday without supervision when i was young, 2 mins without walking with anyone would be alright with her. After finding this out, i tell him 'its only 2 mins away', he replies 'do you know what happened in the news, children get abducted under on min' and then make hurtful statements like ""you think your smarter than everyone else ... you think i don't know that it takes 2 mins!""Everyday, he makes me go look for my keys, when i really dont know where i lost them. Truth is, he was the one who recommended studying law. While i'm getting excellent grades and have competed in numerous competition, because of what he says i begin to question whether i studied law to make him happy or it was a practical career choice i made on my own. I cry by myself thinking about why i have such a shitty memory struggling to remember where my keys were and it may seem silly but im not sure if i wanna continue anymore. I wouldn't go through enough trouble to commit suicide, but honestly if there was a loaded gun in front of me i would not think twice about it. On top of this, i have 2 moot competitions coming up that require a ton of time to prepare (those who do law know this), and its due in a few days time. I dont wanna let my team member down by not pulling up my load of work, but im questioning whether this career choice is right for me anymore. I studied really hard in high school to get to where i am, and gramps was really proud and bragged to everyone about it - then pushed me to do law. Now, i feel he's turning his back on me, saying how just because i did well in high school does not mean i will do well in the future, and strongly asking me how i was going to support my single mothers 300k mortgage. I'm trying really hard to stay on top of my grades, and this requires time on the computer and with books but he keeps disapprovingly saying i should help out the house more, do some housekeeping and reminding me that ""it is your house"" and to stop going on the computer too much. I feel like in his presence, im always depressed, not living up to expectations and i just cry not knowing what to do about it. He reminds me his intentions are well and asks ""do you want me to stop caring for you? if so, then say so and ill leave"" which i know will damage our family relationship and keeps stressing he just wants us to live a better life. Despite this, im really having trouble continuing on without some sort of support or pointer that assures me im going the right way.

The person I called my ""brother"" ended up date raping the love of my life. She has been able to move on and has a family of her own while I'm here mistrusting EVERYONE. My ""best friend"" ghosted me over a measly $500 my elderly mother paid for her to bail out of jail. Looking back I ask myself why I EVER trusted anyone. My mother is the only one I have left who I feel truly cares for me and she's too heartbroken in her own grief over losing my father. I cannot tell her how hurt I am because she will instantly start feeling like it's all her fault. I don't want to kill myself but the physical, emotional and mental pain has been growing and I'm afraid it will tip the scales any moment. 

Every day I'm shown that people really only care about themselves, and my country is slipping closer and closer to hell and/or war with people deciding to turn their heads instead of face the facts. I'm not going to kill myself today because of one reason: It would kill my mom and my soul cannot hold that responsibility.

203511,"I am deeply sad.Hi my name is Jake, 

I'm 18 years old and a freshman in college. I have no reason to be sad, I am in peak physical condition, my grades aren't horrible (1.98 last semester, this semester I have mostly b's but my computer science class has been a serious anchor more on this later), I'm smart, I'm funny, I'm attractive, I have a car, I'm in one of the best fraternities in the country, I'm a privileged upper-middle class white kid. I have no reason to be sad but the truth is I am sad, very sad. 

I can actually point to the specific date and time where I believe this started. At 5:32 7.29.12 my dad came into my room while I was playing minecraft with my friends (this was unusual my parents rarely came into my room) he asked me to come downstairs when I immediately knew something was wrong. My grandmother had ALS at the time so I assumed she took a turn for the worst. I was wrong my parents informed me that they were getting a divorce. This tore my world apart for a while I mean I don't think any kid thinks their parents are going to get a divorce unless things were really outwardly bad. To me though it seemed like my parents still cared for each other and it pained me to see them slowly become more and more bitter towards each other.

This effected some of my decisions that I don't think were very beneficial to me. I chose to go to college in a state that I hate (Az) just because it was far away from my family. Don't get me wrong my university is awesome but goddamn does this fucking state suck. Nothing but sand and dirt and cactus oh I almost forgot about the BLISTERING SUN which is never abated by rain or clouds. 

Once school actually started it gave me some much needed distraction. First semester started SO SO well, I was going to every class, doing all my homework etc. The fraternity process that semester took a serious toll on me. Once I started into it I felt like I had to choose. Be cool or be smart because I sure as hell didn't have time for both. It's not like I didn't try either at one point I was waking up at 6am to work out from 6:30 - 7:30 class from 8-9 then from 11-1 and again at 2:30 - 3:45 and every tuesday and thursday a lab from 5-7. Then I had to be at the house (frat house) with all of my spare time (getting to know the brothers, smoking weed, drinking beer etc.) so that usually put me there anywhere from 5-1am. That wasn't even on days where we had parties (got home around 4:30 - 5). I burnt myself out quick on that, stopped working out, started skipping class etc.

The semester ended with me in a fraternity and my grades not in a good spot. Great I traded my smarts for some dumb ass letters. Second semester also started well, and it was going alright up until a couple weeks before spring break (which was a couple weeks a go). I started thinking about the future a lot and what I wanted to do and I knew that I wanted to work in Japan for a little bit out of the year so I did the rational thing a took Japanese. 5 credits of the hardest class I have ever attempted. The class was labeled as a 101 intro course for people that had no experience with the language. Welp when I showed up on the first day 85% of the class already knew more Japanese than I ever hoped of learning in one semester. This of course encouraged the teacher to move at a ludicrous pace. Anyway I was failing that class pretty handedly so I had to drop it. That stressed me out a lot and didn't really help the whole depression issue. 

My computer science class this semester is what has me particularly worried. I am 3 projects behind and I feel like I have no hope at catching up and I feel like I'm going to be a worthless college drop out working at McDonalds or some shit. Every time I sit down at my computer I get paralyzed, I don't know why or what happens but I'll just sit there and I don't know how to describe it other than 'zoning out'. It isn't like I slip into a day dream either its more of me being conscious of the fact that I am just sitting there but time somehow just gets away from me and the next time I check the clock its been 1-2-3 hours. I don't even do anything like reddit or youtube, just sit there being paralyzed looking at my assignment being taunted by it. As if its saying haha I know you won't finish me. 

My friends (outside of the fraternity) have also changed. It may just be my perception of them but damn some of them I feel may have gone off the deep end. They take my food, use my car, mess with things on my computer and generally mess with my stuff when I'm not in the room. Now I made very clear rules at the beginning that no one was to: Eat my food, drive my car without asking, NEVER touch my computer unless its for chrome and finally don't fucking touch my bed/blankets. They were VERY good about all of these rules until maybe 1-2 weeks before spring break. Slowly but surly (hate to say it like this but) I almost think they were slowly breaking the rules just to see if they could piss me off. It worked. They don't feel like friends anymore to me. This is taxing on my emotions.

Randomly throughout the day I get sudden extreme 'sadness' that isn't really caused by something that I can quantify and pinpoint, I get choked up and feel tears welling up in my eyes. It feels like I'm crazy after writing down all of this because of how much shit I can't believe I've had to deal with up until now.

The point of my post is that I have been seeing a psychiatrist and taking anti-depressants for a while now and it hasn't helped me in any significant way and I'm done trying to fix this. My life is very insignificant, there are 12 - 35 people that would be truly sad to see me go. In a world of 7.2 billion in a galaxy 100,000 ly across in a universe infinitely vast, letting down 35 people doesn't seem like a big deal.

203529,"Unexplainable FeelingsI'm a 16 year old junior and I've thought of numerous ways to kill myself and just make these terrible thoughts in my head go away, my luck with forums is that nobody actually responds to me but it feels good to write about this either way. It'll be over soon. My depression ( i hate that word so fucking much but its the only word that will sort of describe my feelings) started freshman year of high school, I was always the kid that was trying to make other kids laugh, the annoying class clown. However freshman year changed everything it was as if I was a completely different person, i had different feelings different interests, everything changed i wasn't myself anymore. Of all the people that i was aquainted with nobody really gave a shit except for my best friend, mainly because he went through the same thing, in his own way. Anyways freshman year ended and I became a sophomore and that year was a lot worse, however there were a couple months of that year where i didn't cry myself to sleep. Those months were the best months of my life. Unfortunately it all came back and I'm in my junior year right now and ive gotten really close with my guidance counselor. My sister who graduated a long time(as valedictorian ) knew him and they always talked, she still talks to him till this day. Anyways he took a personal interest in me once i entered high school and he noticed this sudden change of behavior i have had. My thoughts are so scrambled because i dont know what to say, i have to much to say, writing a novel would be better. I always feel sorry for myself and im always so nihilistic. Once my guidance counselor finally realized what had happened, he would always talk to me and say your sister has my number if you ever need anything. I once brought up being suicidal and i wish i never did, he looked at me differently and i sort of liked that, i liked that he felt fucking bad for me. Why the fuck? What kind of person thinks like that? Whenever he'd talk to me or anything id say im okay but i liked that he was persistent and kept coming back. I dont think i kept doing that because i wanted to feel better and needed help, i just liked being the fucking victim and making him feel bad for me. Whenever I've thought about suicide i think about what kind of effect it would have on my family, and when id think about it id sorta like it because i thought about everyone in my family crying, I'm not a normal fucking person. The only reason i havent killed myself yet is because i want to see what my fucked up brain can accomplish, and hey if it never works out and i dont become a surgeon like i want to, which will probably never happen (i have shit grades), i can always kill myself then. Im not going to read this through and go over all my mistakes because itll only make me feel worse, ive missed a shit load of things that are indescribable. Anyways yeah.",suicide

I'm basically the target where they let their toxicity on. we are kinda poor. my confidence is zero also because I have a lazy eye (which could be temporary fixed by a simple pair of glasses but my famiily cannot afford them. or atleast they act like it since when they need something, they immediately get it and do everything to get it. for example: my father's tv, my brother's brand new phone). I'm introverted but atleast I've somehow managed to make some friends; however, they live in a bigger town half an hour (by car, by bus it's like two hours) from where I live. In that town I also go to school, where I met them (now my social interactions are non-existent also due to covid, which is a big problem here).

I became friends in the middle of this year with a great guy. He’s very bright, constantly busy and very reserved, in his early 30s, active Army who’s done multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan but is now studying.

We became very close very quickly. Occasionally he’d make comments about not living to see 40 or talking about when he dies he wants this at his funeral, things like that. I didn’t know how to react at those times so I always told him that he’d live a really long time so we wouldn’t have to think about that for awhile.

I became a source of emotional and intellectual support over the next few months, we talked all day. But he was still casually dating other people. At the end of September, I told him I couldn’t just be friends anymore because I wanted a romantic relationship. He said he wasn’t willing and able to give that. We haven’t spoken in two months as I said that he was great but this was too difficult for me.

Anyways I saw him today in passing and I just felt something was off. I also recently heard he’s planning to leave his part-time job, which I know he likes. It’s hard to explain but I just have a gut feeling like he’s thinking about ending things. I care about him a lot and wondering whether to reach out somehow, but at the same time it’s hard/sad for me to know he doesn’t want to be a relationship with me,

At 16, my best friend left me for her boyfriend after rejecting me and telling me ""I have a boyfriend now, I don't need you anymore"" and never talking to me again. I tried everything, nothing worked.

At 18, my ""cousin"" (we aren't real cousins, marital thing) who we went together so well and who I relied on for most of my problems and she relied on me for hers more often, left me for her boyfriend after having me help her start a relationship with him. She did it because I told her not to have sex with him, and she did, told me she did, and said that I treated her like shit and she would never talk to me again.

At 22, I am called to a motor vehicle incident. When I arrived I was the first one on scene and it was a wrong way collision, head on. There was a truck and a car, car had drifted into the wrong lane. Both the occupants in the truck were okay but the woman driving the car was unresponsive, but I instantly recognized who she was when I saw her face, it was the girl who left me at 16. By the time I pulled her out of the vehicle my buddy and paramedics had already arrived and performed CPR, but to no success. She was to be taken a local hospital, I followed shortly after and was told that she had died likely before I was even on scene. Her mother, who recognized me also, from so many years ago told me that ""I was the reason her daughter died, I let her die"", but there was nothing more I could have done. 

I never got the chance to talk to her again or to make things right with her, and now I never will.

I'm sure half only did so because they were coerced or something like my brother and because it was strange that a person I hadn't spoken to in a year and hadn't cared to say happy birthday to me last year, suddenly texted me out of the blue to say happy birthday. I was gonna just throw myself off a building but that doesn't seem very viable so I will just hang myself instead I think. Today I was testing putting pressure on my throat, first with my hands then with a belt. You see, I don't do this on impulse. I plan things out so it won't fail, I won't do this without knowing it's very unlikely I will mess up and fail. I was holding on until after my birthday to do it (bc of said thing I mentioned before) and I'm not even interested in anything anymore, not even the one thing that was giving me artificial serotonin or whatever so I kept living but now there is not a single difference between me sitting in bed all day, scrolling pages endlessly just to do something vs being dead. I can't imagine myself living past 20. Tomorrow I might just try to find some rope and practice with that, or I need to buy some but I can barely even make myself get out of bed and can't even take care of myself so I don't know how I will manage to. I don't even feel like eating and when I do eat I feel sick. I feel like my body wants me to die, just like my head wants me to so badly. 

I know nobody will probably even read this, and if they do they'll leave generic comments telling me not to kill myself, that they 'care' and 'love' me which only make me want to do it more. I do not like it when people pretend to care. i'll probably delete this anyway bc i know nobody cares really :)",suicide

There’s a lot on my mind and a lot that I want to say, but that would take too long. I guess I’ve just gotten to the extreme low point of depression, anxiety, stress, low self esteem, to where I don’t think I want help anymore. I’ve been suicidal for so long now, and I started cutting again. Each time the cuts get deeper and I’m always tempted to try killing myself with pills. The only thing keeping me here anymore is the fear of failure, but even that is starting to slip away. I keep skipping school because of the immense stress and anxiety it gives me, and because I keep missing assignments. It’s hard being around people, especially family who don’t understand, and it’s hard being alone on my own. I’m not sure what I’ll gain by venting on reddit, but it’s a nice way to be fully honest and not have to pretend like I’m ok. I plan on killing myself eventually and I’m not sure when, but soon. I don’t believe that life is worth living when all I’ve been doing for 5 years is this. Just nothing other than being a complete mental fuck up. I’m debating whether or not to kill myself today with tylenol and just get it over with. I’ve had enough with stalling and wondering which day is the one I’ll snap. It’s so hard living and I’ve just been crying nonstop about everything on my mind. I’m sorry to anyone who cares about me, which I’m pretty sure is just a few people.

It seems that things just seem to be getting worse and worse for me. 

26, recently got fired from my job, still living at home (sleeping on the couch as theres no space for me), rethinking my entire career path (this includes my 4 year degree, and 3 years working in the chosen field). To top this shit off, I got a speeding ticket last week AND I woke up this morning to a flat tire on my shitty car. 

I'm stressed to fuck, and have my parents pointing out my flaws and what I'm doing wrong rather than telling me things are gonna be fine.

I got a call from an agency today about some temporary admin work. Which I'm thinking is a good idea, take a temporary job whilst I figure out what the fuck im gonna do career wise. No point in starting a permanent job and leaving it months later because I hate it right? Then getting comments I dont need from my parents like 'I thought you hated admin work and working with people'. 

I'm just lost. I need to figure out what im gonna do because I'm not getting any younger. Changing careers is a kick in the teeth for me because I've wanted to be in my chosen field since I was 15. And then you start working in the industry and realise how shit it is and that it pays such a low wage when it asks for a degree AND experience.

I have a couple of close friends who i can turn to when I need to but it makes me feel like i am being a drain on them despite them being very nice to me.

I was kicked out of home at age 16 and my dad doesn't want to be a part of my life anymore (i had a party when he went was out, i threw it for my girlfriend who then proceeded to sleep with all of my friends and lie to me about it) 

I feel abandonded by my family, i feel like i exploit my friends. and most of all i feel like a fat lazy motherfucker.

i need some tips on how to better motivate myself

Here is a list of the medication i take.

I smoke marijuana almost every day because it helps me take my mind of the fact that my family thinks i am a cunt.

I take dexamphetamine when i have to do work so i can pay attention (i get distracted very easily)

I smoke ciggerettes because i am a worthless piece of shit and don't respect my own body.

I havn't had a job in three months and now have $1 to my name.

I have almost 0 self esteem on most days and i don't feel like i am worth peoples time. Because most people i try to talk to just write me off as useless and not worth their time.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of November, my girlfriend of 9 years left me because I was depressed. Hated my job, hated waking up in the morning to get ready for work. She had enough of me complaining about my life and left.

&amp;#x200B;

I then spend like 7 week of just drinking every nights. On january 20. I got drunk of hard liquor and found out my ex-girlfriend was seeing someone else while she was telling me she would think things over. I said my farewell to some people over facebook, told my ex to take care of the cats and went to hang myself. Somehow, it failed and I ended up on the floor for some time before a friend burst in my appartement followed by the police shortly after. They took me to the hospital and I saw a therapist the morning after. Now I have antidepressants to take and I got a new job as well that I like, I'm working for a federal politician, so it's nice.  I also been sober for 21 days now.

&amp;#x200B;

Things have been running smoothly for like 16 days, haven't spoke to my ex since the attempt and then a few days ago she came to my place without asking. Came back from work, saw her in the driveway and I drove off. She saw me and texted me she was sorry for leaving me so I took the bait, felt stable enough to speak with her. She cried for an hour, I spent one more hour to cheer her up then we cuddled a little and then she suddenly left. Fastfoward to today, I'm asking her why she came back like this to leave right away and she says she can't be with me right now and needs to think our relation over again and that she might come back or she might not.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having issue right now, and It's pissing me off for the first time in all these days that I failed to take my life. These toughts are crawling back into my head and I want to have a drink and get this done with. I feel like I'll never be whole again and this emptiness is killing me. I don't know if I should hang on, keep my hopes up ... I don't know. Been reading this sub and I guess it help me think that it might not be the best decision to end it all.

She was nice and I felt like she was mostly listening to me and wanted to help but the scope of my issues is just too wide for any one conversation to make a dent. Ive seen this sentiment shared here before so Im hoping someone else might understand.

I contact hotlines when things get rough so I can be physically occupied for a bit and talk about how i feel without bothering the people in my life who are just as burnt out and scared and confused by my problems as I am. So I dont think my expectations are too high or anything. I dont expect to be fixed or helped or understood, just acknowledged. And I usually get that and it usually calms me down. I just feel so awful once it's over! Its a different awful than I start with (loud, active despair vs. low-energy resignation and hopelessness) but the intensity is comparable. Sometimes I feel guilty for taking up so much of the volunteer's time when I know they cant ""help"" me as much as they could help someone whose issues are less all-encompassing and life-destroying. Other times I feel ashamed when I notice the other person trying to end the conversation and I get clingy and resist because I just dont want to be alone again.

I have recently been given a lot more responsibility at work. This requires me to gain a lot of new knowledge and coordinate activities to make rapid progress on a critical project. However, instead of spending my nights and weekends gaining this knowledge, which appears to be absolutely criticial, I am filling all of my watching Twitch and YouTube, often until 2:30am. Literally 80% or more of my waking hours this holiday weekend have been spent lying down watching Twitch or YouTube on my phone.

I don't see the point in making any effort with this project if I can never be happy again. Why should I pour myself into my work if there is no payoff (even in the distant future)? I am still going to be a short, bald man will a small penis (also probably fat). 

I don't want to see this scenario play out. In which this project fails and I am fired and my reputation is ruined. I am simply not interested in life anymore. So, I want to hang myself this week.

The app will be getting banned from all app stores in America tomorrow, and I'm sure we've all seen the memes expressing how joyous everyone here is about it. But I for one am not. 


This app has brought many amazing opportunities to many amazing creators. Many people have literally started their careers in becoming content creators on this app. I've even seen a great few be signed by record labels over their music they have posted on the app (my favorite being Carson James Argenna) 


Of course you are probably going to comment about how the app tracks data and sells it. Which may or may not be true. But one thing is for certain is that some people mad a LIVING on that app. And we are just going g to hate on them for what? Making more money than us?

Firstly, I'm in absolute awe of the work that the members of this community do on a daily basis.  

I guess my point of posting here is to query if life, after you've experiences an extremely privileged range of existence, ever gets better?  It's starting to feel like there's few novel experiences left in life.  

I've experienced professional success (at least compared to the average wage of my country). I've travelled extensively, and spent time living abroad in a few different countries. I've volunteered in humanitarian and wildlife conservation roles.  I've been in love.  I've broken up.  I've supported family members and friends in achieving success.  I've lost family members and friends to terminal illnesses and accidents.

I've experienced therapy, drugs, lifestyle changes, and sabbaticals in monasteries.  While my experiences and thoughts have been somewhat dynamic, a consistent theme has been [Anhedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia).

This is my last. I'm going to be unsubbing from here. Maybe I'll resub at a later date, once I'm definitely 100%, and I'll come back to help people, the same way people in this sub helped me. Not much has changed, but I generally feel better. I'm not sure why, but something has changed and I don't know what, but something has. And I feel slightly better. For now, I actually feel okay. I know I'm not out of the woods yet, but I'm getting there. I know there's plenty more obstacles, but I am actually looking forward to encountering them. I'm starting to relish the challenge. 

Like I said, I have no idea what has changed. I still go to work at 4:30am, come home and sit in my room, watching TV or on my phone. 

All I want to say is thank you to everyone who helped, or even tried to help. I am a difficult person to help, I know that. I've always thought I should do everything alone, that a real man never asks for help. But I was wrong. It doesn't matter if you're 14 or 40. It doesn't matter if you're Male, female, trans, or you have no idea what you are. It doesn't matter if you are hard on the exterior, or soft. We all need help sometimes. We can't do everything by ourselves. And that's okay. 

For now, I'm leaving this sub. And thank you again, to everyone who helped or at least tried. I appreciate it.

203726,"2/8/18, Rambles of honestyI feel like there is so much for me to feel at once and I cannot control all my feelings. I just want them to leave me. I get jealous of numb er people, but at the same after shoving my own feelings down, I guess I am numb too. I think I lost a part of my humanity, hopefully not all. I know I did have more empathy than this before. 

When I was younger, I always wanted to be kind. I wanted to make people happy. I still value it, if it happens, but whenever I try, I try too much, and I get taken advantage of. If I don't, I really don't, and can be a total ass. I feel terribly either way. I think I struggle with emotional boundaries, maybe. 

I don't really relate to other people like I used to, maybe I'm mentally ill or something, and not just anxiety and depression. I do want to be a kind person, but it all seems so fake. Why doesn't helping others make me happy anymore? Why did I forget how to cheer people up? I think depression is contagious. I gradually found my way through life with sad and sadder people. 

I barely count as a human being.

I don't think I deserve love, because when I do, people get hurt. They notice how dependant I get. They feel guilty that I'm just chronically depressed no matter how much they try to fix me. And I wish someone would fix me, somehow. But I leave them, to help them, to get rid of their burden on me. And then I hurt more. 

It's complicated. I like people. I just wish I felt a part of them, us. Why do I feel so disconnected?  I daydream a lot, too much, and I feel myself slipping into dissociation so much I can barely do anything. My life seems pointless. Why go on, feeling this? Remembering things I don't want to, pitying myself, getting angry at others...

People say you need a support system, but in order to build one, you need basic common sense, right? One that isn't washed away by all the negative thoughts in your head. One that... doesn't let you answer honestly when someone asks how you are doing and one that is just a bit more caring of how stupid you sound when you speak... a bit more aware. So I'm stuck.

Insurance doesn't cover my therapy, so I can't have that. I... don't think therapy would help me much on a lot of things I do struggle with.

It isn't just myself, it's other people. And just the world. I have a lot of philsophical anxiety, I guess. I worry a lot and overanalyze everything, like my thoughts. I have a lot of bad thoughts, and sometimes I forget to worry about them, so I hate myself even more for not caring. I just switch it on and off without knowing how. I want to kill people sometimes, but I also really value forgiveness and kindness. How can I tell a therapist I want to kill people? Especially when I want to seem like a normal person? I'm so confused. I'm so confused about everything.

It feels like everything nice I do is just fake. I'm just a liar, I'm not real. But I don't know what the real me is like, it's probably the really sensitive, pathetic feelings, right? 

Because good people don't think that way. Good people have happier thoughts. At least, they would get bothered by them. I don't want to think this is how I am. Why am I so sensitive to people? Why do I want a peaceful world, but fantasize about destroying it? And sometimes people say it's normal, it's just thoughts, but I put a lot of thought into my thoughts. It's like a curiosity, but I don't want to ruin my life over it. I don't think it'd be worth it. But. I don't know. It fasinates me... And I shouldn't, I shouldn't want to.

So I want to kill myself, for the better of people. I do believe in love, but I think I'm a part of the problem. I have so much hate in me. I do not know how to forgive. I've even joked in the past why don't people just kill themselves instead of other people. I think I agree with myself now. Even, strangly, I just want to maybe keep that one person who would do anything for me, and know I can count on them, but something seems so wrong in basically enslaving a loved one right, to just stop their free will. That is fucked up shit, yeah. That is not how relationships work.

I really want a better world. Where everything is just... wonderful as it can be. Without me. Being all... sad... and making everyone else sad... And being a burden to feed and house, or talk to. Because people are interesting and I think they can do great things when they have the opprotunity. I don't think I could contribute much to this world. I'm not good at anything, and these human emotions are too strong for me. I wish everyone else... calmer days. x

I failed out of music school and boy was it public. I wander the halls like a ghost, and everyone reacts to me as if I really were one. The friends I did make I’ve managed to push away. I talk to no one.

I’ve realized that nothing genuinely interests me. I’ve ingrained the thought into my head that I will find a way to end it but I never do. I’m 23, with nothing to show for it. I broke up with my last boyfriend because I didn’t want him to see me like this. I’ve spent the last month prepping myself for failure, hardly getting out of bed because I am convinced it’s going to end soon. I spend a good portion of the day researching potential suicide methods (because it’s strangely comforting) and poring through r/depression and r/suicidewatch to remind me that I’m not alone no matter how lonely I feel. 

I’ve fallen into these long-term depressive states multiple times before and got out of them - only to find myself in the same exact spot. I don’t really know why I’m writing this right now. I guess I’m just rambling to get something out there.

Alright this might sound a bit stupidborn ? I just don't get it, and someone might be able to explain it to me, or share their own opinion, or just experience of the situation. Alright so had these 3 friends once, each at different times. The first one, was the first person i ever opened up to. Due to a harsh childhood, with a father with anger problems, which ended up him beating me almost everyday, and a mother who couldn't say no to him, and always being the unwanted child. One day she just abandoned me, without a trace of what i did wrong. Which really destroyed me. From that time i closed myself in from the normal sociaty, because i didn't wanted to get hurt again. After 6 years of me being alone, i finally found someone who i throught, i could open up to. I did and he got down with depression, and quited everything. He left the school, and deleted contacts to everyone. Including me. So again i was hurted, and so on bla bla... Don't want this to be too long. Here this year i found this girl named Julie, which filled all the emptiness inside me but i fucked a little bit up. I was a little to clingy, and confessed my love (yeah i love her and i still do) Too her at a very bad time, and now 1 month and 21 days later (still counting) i still miss her everyday. If she could be here again just as a friend i would be forever gratefull. She doesn't care about me, she has replaced me. So my question to everybody, if you made it through my whining. Is have you experienced anything similar? Because as i mentally stand, i can't open up to people anymore. Before you rant about ""Just because a few things, isn't going your way."" then think about this for a few second. They where the only persons, i trusted without a shadow of a doubt, and they all betrayed me. It may not seem like a big deal for you, but for me it certainly is.

I also have this childhood friend called, Astrid (Which i fucking adore i love that girl) but i don't know if i can trust her, enough to tell her all this. I'm scared she is going to leave me too.
She has her own problems, and her own life. I dont want to ruin it with my life problems, just because i can't be happy doesnt mean i should drag others down with me.",suicide

My mind wants to be free but my body does not allow. I want to run free with all my heart. I want to become bigger and stronger with my fellow classmates, yet my body does not permit. Some force is teasing me always. Giving me a breathe of fresh air before chopping my limbs off. I was bulimic once. Fucked my life right then and there. Started as a safety net. My mind was not ready however. I lost weight, let alone losing my friends. For a year my body and mind were slowly degrading. My muscle, my hair, my personality, and my life was changing. I now am no longer bulimic but my life is still affected. Im a boy in highschool. Every 30 minutes i have to go pee. Every part of my body besides my stomach is malnourished. I just want to die im crying right now im so sad. Everyday i wear a mask. A mask of happiness. I try so hard to find joy in the world but i cant. I see my friends and classmates go places, workout, and play sports while i can hardly do anything. My shouder, its been strained for the last 8 months. My leg pinches when i raise it and my thigh has been numb for the last 2 months. I lve had so many ankle, knee, and thigh problems that i cant even count them anymore. I just want to be a kid. I cant do any of the things i love. A girl i really like is always wanting to go to an open gym with me or run but its so hard to do either with my shoulder and leg. I eat as much food as i can stuff in my face but it doesnt fix any of my problems. My parents still think i have an ED and think i starve myself so they believe thats the problem. But i dont have an ED anymore, my parents are just never there to see what i do. I want to workout and get stronger so badly but every excercise i do makes my shoulder and leg worse. I just want to know that someday my body will not be injured. Its so hard to keep myself together every day and find the motivation to go on. One day im feeling a little better, i start to think things might get brighter for me. Then the next day everything is back to the shit. Its just so dam sad that this super nice girl likes me and i can hardly do anything with her because of my body. Shes always the one who sees through my happiness. She knows im sad but she doesnt really understand why. I tell her again and again im not upset with her but she thinks i am. I told her straight up what was making me sad but it still doesnt change the fact that i cant do the things we love together. My family cant afford to much more therapy for my leg and shoulder. Its sad that im not getting better. I do my excercises but my body doesnt seem to respond as well as it should. I just want to feel strong and healthy. It is so hard to OD on pain meds everytime i want to hang out with this girl. I dont understand the reasoning behind all this pain. Mabye its to teach me a lesson, or to make me feel hyper realistic. The book Fahrenheit 451 is beautiful. Society is drawn such a finite matter that the parrel between us and them is clear as day. I want to kill myself. Im told that if i stay postive everything will eventually get better. Yeah. Ive heard it so many times. People in this world have much worse problems then i do. I never really felt for them in the way i do now. I feel their pain. Unable to workout or do kid things is making me feel so depressed.

203797,"Random RantHey guys. I'm just putting this here. tbh, i don't even know if it goes here or not. 

I do know that the old feelings are creeping back up again though. I still kind of wish I ended it but, I don't. I don't want to wish I ended it because if I did it when I had, I wouldn't have been able to talk my friend out of it when he was at a low point. I acknowledge the fact that had I not been there, he could've went through with the attempt. But another part of me is like maybe if I had done it, I would've triggered a small change and he possibly would've not had to go through that situation in the first place. The people I know now that love me, believe in me, wouldn't be burdened with my existence. In my mind there were only three real attempts I made. One was by knife, the others were by trying to get someone else to do it. My very first attempt was freshman year of high school. and it's been a while since I've decided to get help.

I've kind of started getting help now. Although, only when I get like this it's when I feel like I need help. I've kind of stopped trying to end it, but tbh I thought about another way to do it today. I don't want to do that though. I don't want to leave my SO. I do feel like they'd be better off without me though. I suppose the main reasons why I'm not actively trying to end it is because of my SO's love for me, some of my friends, and basically two members of my family.

I just keep feeling like I'm not enough, like I'm not doing enough. I don't fully reciprocate all the love my SO gives me. i don't always go visit my family, and tbh there could still be a chance one of them will get ripped away from me. I know pain is a part of the experience and whatnot, that it doesn't exactly define us; that it shapes who we are. But I don't want to feel pain anymore. I don't want to keep bringing down my SO's spirits whenever I feel like this. I don't want to keep making them sad whenever I negative self talk. I want them to be with someone they deserve and that equally deserves them. I don't think that's me though. My family deserves someone that's in contact with them more. My friends deserve someone that will go out of their way for them.

I don't know if I made the wrong choices. I don't know what i should do. I don't think I deserve to live if I's willing to give my life away, There are so many other people fighting to live. People that are getting their lives taken from them, and I'm just being a waste of space. I probably have a huge carbon footprint and am only adding to the increasing amount of chaos that's already in the world.

Its not from lack of trying, hell I've posted 13 ads on craigslist, a few on reddit, and even joined those ridiculous dating apps. All to no avail.

I've been thinking for a while about wether or not i should post on reddit, but now i am..

I'm 18 years old, and I want to die but I could never kill myself.. I want to die by an accident or murder or what else it could be.. Everyday on my way to school I just imagine myself getting run over, or the train im on colliding with something else and killing me instantly. When im in a car wether that be with my family or a friend (i dont drive) I also wish that we would be in a car accident and i would die. I would never in a million years wish for something to happen to my family or friends, ever. But i want to die, i just dont want it to be my fault. I could never put my family and loved ones through the pain of me killing myself, never. Even if i could i know im too scared to anyway, and i just dont want to kill myself. I dont get bullied or anything like that, i have enough money and my family supports me with it too if i need it, i have a lot of friends, i have both my parents and my brothers, we go on vacations, i have a roof over my head, food in my belly, and i can take a shower whenever i want to. I dont have any traumas or diagnoses. Nothing at all has happened in my life that make me understand why i feel the way i do. Nothing is wrong.. I've tried to talk with my mom and such and she just tells me to sleep more, go out more with my friends. I've sobbed in her face an entire night trying to get help, but she just pushed me away like it was just ""something i was going through"" like a phase or something.. But i've been feeling this way for years. I didn't tell her that because i feel like she won't believe me, and i can understand why.. Because there's no reason for me to feel this way..

There was one time, in my school.. I live in Scandinavia btw. Where we were on lockdown for half an hour, because of a 'potential' shooter (it turned out just be some students filming a video for a class, of course). We were locked in a room and the threat was extremely real in those 30 minutes. And i realized that i wasn't scared of dying.. I was just thinking of how much it would hurt when it happened, and imagining it. I was only sad for my friends who were in the same position as me and how much they didn't deserve to die and that i couldn't text my parents goodbye because i didn't have my phone, but i was just thinking ""finally."" for me.

We tried to get me a psychiatrist of sorts but the insurance wouldn't cover it. Probably because there wasn't a shooter so nothing happened.

I just really dont know where to go from here. I try my best to be happy and to be with my friends and all but as soon as im alone all i can think about is how everything in life is just so short, and that there just isn't any reason to it all. Im not a threat to my self in any way, dont worry. I would never seek out death.. At least not right now. Im just kind of living day by day and waiting to die. I feel like im just not living for myself, i'm living for my loved ones..

I dont know what to do.. What can i do to feel better, or to stop thinking this way? It's okay if you don't know how to help.. I just wanted to try and reach out in some way..

im sorry,

Have a nice day",suicide
203824,"I don't have a reasonSince I was kid I loved football, I was probably the happiest person on the planet just with the ball. The time flew and life was pretty much beautiful, because football was the way for me to forget the world, forget all the problems. 

Later in high-school, I was diagnosed with tumor in my knee, had to stop doing all activities. Slowly stopped talking to people, kept everything in me, gained few pounds, started to hate the world, why me. 

My life became just gaming for few years, sure there were attempts on girls, but I've been so lucky that first I fell for moved to Paris, 2nd moved to Canada. (I'm from Slovakia) The another attempt broke me so hard, that I wasn't talking to anyone anymore. Then something happened with my skin, had terrible acne for maybe another 3 years, trying to get rid of it any way, but it just didn't work out. 

I've been so done with my life, thinking about why should I even live? What's next for me? What's the point, cut connection with ""friends"" who only needed me when they wanted something, but if I wanted something they disappeared like ghosts.

Finished high school, started Uni, it felt good for a while. But my acne got even worse, I was afraid of going into public, I was scared of what are other people thinking. I tried fucking everything to get rid of it. Can't invite that beautiful girl out with that ugly acne scarface, can't go out without everyone looking and pointing at you. So I stayed home, forgot all the social life, got a little job while studying so I won't have to think about all the bullshit.

After 4 years, and probably millionth attempt of getting rid of it, I saw it's getting better, even if the pills caused depression(even bigger than I had) I was getting happier cos it was looking good. Around 3 months later that semester, we had this group project where we were 3 boys and 1 girl, I barely knew her, cos she arrived to our class just this semester. I didn't think much but after talking about this project we kept kinda longer and it was really nice feeling. Later that day she texted me she have to see me tomorrow asap. She got me, 3 years older, beautiful girl, which I couldn't even imagine wanted to see me.

Next almost 3 months were so beautiful, we were going for trips all around, getting to know each other, everything looked so good. I started to gain confidence, after maybe 7 years? I started to visit gym, started to love running again, everything looked so perfect.

Then, I bought her roses, she made the dinner, we had beautiful night, and very next day she simply didn't even wanted to talk, write or anything. And since we had this ""family sharing"" where you can see each other location anytime (it was her idea), I checked it randomly and she was with her ex. Who she was cursing probably whole time, how the hell she even was able to be with him, how she can't stand him even 1 minute when she wanted to pack he things and so on.

Things escalated and work got full of rage, people screaming at each other, school became unbearable, literally everything went downhill after that. 

I can't focus anymore, she was the reason, I tried to look at everything from the lighter side. To say, fuck all the bad, and focus on her, because she made me smile, she was the only person who said to me I love you, after 23 years I though I found someone, who actually cares. 

But it was probably just a game, I wake up early at 4AM thinking about why? I usually wake up at 6AM going for an early run saying it will be nice day. Now I can't. I try to run, I quit. I don't see happiness in it anymore. I don't see happiness in anything. Tried gym again, tried everything I loved, games, films, nothing works now. She gave me hope and she took it away. 

I've got my papers ready, I'm ready to end all of this, I've been thinking about suicide(really close to it) twice in my life, somehow I made kept going. But I'm not so strong this time, I just don't have a reason anymore, don't have a will to breath.",suicide
203825,"I’m not meant to surviveWhen I talk about being suicidal, people dismiss me with “you’re so young! things will get better for you!” But then I hear stories about people who live to be 40, 50, 60 and are still miserable. Why should I spend decades just hoping things might get better when I know they won’t? 

I’ve also heard it said that people who die young weren’t meant to survive. If I’m not meant to live, why fight to keep suffering? Everything in my life is awful and on a downward trend, so it’s not unreasonable to want this pain to end. And don’t give me that BS about “suicide doesn’t end the pain, it just gives it to others.” No one cares for me now, and although they’ll pretend when I die, within a month they’ll have forgotten me. 

Honestly, the only thing keeping me from walking into the woods and blowing my brains out right now is knowing that someone would have to cover my shift at work. But I’ve asked for a week off next month, which will be plenty of time for me to die and be replaced without incident.",suicide

He says it has nothing to do with me, but I know he just wants to make me feel better.   THIS IS MY FAULT for calling/texting him at work and being emotionally manipulative.  It's what I do.  I leave everyone else's lives in a wreckage behind me and then move on as if nothing happened.  I'm a fucking vampire.  I live by creating chaos and draining the life out of other people. This is not the first person I've done it to; it's been an ongoing pattern all my life. Changing my behavior will not help if it's even possible; the damage is already done and I will never forgive myself. I will also never forgive myself for not having committed suicide this summer when I still had money in my savings that I could at least leave to the people I care about. I am a destructive piece of shit and I am beyond help.

203841,"This is my very first post, I'm not allowed to get therapy. Any help is appreciatedI truly think I have an anxiety disorder. I have the biggest fear of being embarrassed, I over react to things nearly all of the time, and it really effects my relationships. 
On top of that, I have really bad depression. Self diagnosed, but I think the thought of suicide explains it. My parents won't allow me to go to therapy.
After a lot of thinking, I think my depression comes from not feeling important. I think this is because I am a middle child, my two sisters and I are all 5 years apart. And I think I look for something to ease that sore spot through relationships, because it makes me feel like I matter to someone. My parents don't make me feel important. That's for sure. They're scared of my older sister, and my little sister is too stubborn. It's gotten to the point that when we go out for a family dinner, I get left out. They talk about work with my older sister, sports with the younger, and they're so busy on them they don't have time to ask me how my week has been, etc. My parents' friend found out I was planning on killing myself, and he told them and they refused to take me to therapy still. All they did was scold at me and continue their daily lives. This only made it worse.
The depression and the anxiety create this terrible mix that goes hand in hand. The only reason why I haven't killed myself yet is because I'm a coward. Lately, I've become more risk taking and caring less and the thought of death doesn't scare me anymore. I'm only hoping that something else ends my life.
I'm in college, with exams coming up and I honestly feel like there's no hope for me, just turning 18 and live in an upper middle class family. I'm spoiled, but unlike most spoiled kids I don't take my parents buying me cars for granted.
I don't know what kind of background information is needed to help resolve these problems. I want to learn how to deal with it, not someone to vent to. I need a new way of thinking along with it.

203846,"Will my suicidal ideation ever go away?I have an objectively good life. The one thing that is significantly hard is that my husband and I have tens of thousands in debt, largely due to medical issues that I have had. Subsequently, we are always stressed and can never save, and all our income goes down the tube of debt.  And I still deal with the “invisible disability” of chronic pain from those medical procedures. But beyond that, I have it made. My husband is a wonderful person. I have a toddler I love with my whole being and who is healthy and delightful. I have achieved a career dream, getting paid to do my art form. I try to give back to society by working with sick children part time. An outsider would think I had a great life. However, when I was a teen I attempted suicide. My stomach was pumped. And for the next 15 years, though I’ve never made another attempt, I’ve continued to suffer from intense suicidal thoughts, only somewhat dependent on my external circumstances. After the high school incident I swore to my mother I would never do that to her again, and every time I’ve gotten close to doing anything, I’ve remembered that promise, and her look of pain. And now I have this precious child, who would be destroyed without me. And yet. So much sends me into a state of panic and sorrow. I continue to suffer trauma from a rape, but it was a decade ago, and I am past it in many ways. But with all this sexual assault in the news.... I sometimes feel like I’m that girl again. In that room. And I’m getting help. I have a therapist. I am on a low dosage of anti depressants and have been for years. But everything causes me anxiety. Even things that should be “good.” For example, I am objectively at least medium-level attractive, and yet I obsess over how ugly I FEEL (reality be damned). I hate my stomach. And i can’t let it go. 
I achieved a career dream, and yet now I get into states of panic over writing that next book, and the deadline, and how I can’t do it. 
And if I have a moment in which I lose my temper with my daughter I think Oh well, I’ll just be an angry fucked up Mom like mine was and my daughter would be better off without me. 
What I’m trying to say is... No matter how good I have it, my self hatred and intense desire to disappear from this earth consumes me sometimes in ways that harken back to that 17 year old who ODed on Ambien and champagne. And after years of therapy and anti-depressants, if I can have a “good life” and still struggle with so much anxiety and so many moments in which I want to die... will it ever get better? Or am I a broken person? I don’t feel there is anyone to talk to because they just say “Look how good your life is!” And they’re right.

Trust me, I never ever felt loved so much by a person and the accident ruined everything in a second. Her parents didn't allow me to see her in hospital and didn't let any of her friends to talk with her for like three months. During those three months I was depressed like hell, didn't talk with anyone. And after three months, I found out the terrible truth, she LOST HER MEMORY AND HER PARENTS USED THAT TO GET HER ENGAGED TO SOMEONE FROM THEIR RELIGION :/ 



Edit: Let me tell you another facet of her parents. So she was my junior in college and we were both doing engineering, I 4 job offers while still in college and I was one of the best students from my stream of engineering. So all they ever told is that I don't belong to their religion and I shouldn't talk with her. They even took me to police station in their area, and made me feel like shit by slapping because the fucking police belongs to their religion and he didn't say a thing instead he warned me. So immediately after that incident we got holidays, semester break actually so she was at home and they used that to do all the things that you mentioned. She literally saw hell at home, no one to talk to. I don't know how the hell even her mom tolerated that, so just when I was about to file a human rights violation case on her parents, her father attempted suicide and he was hospitalized. She got scared but she still didn't give up on me, she loved me so much that any amount of brainwashing or manipulative bullshit can do nothing to her. So after three months of the accident, she came to college and she couldn't recognize her friends. So her parents weaved a story making me the bad guy, and now they brainwashed her so that she is hating the sight of me. I tried to file a law suit but it didn't stand in the court because I am from a country where corruption is rampant and the 99% of the parents which also includes judges think the same way as her parents. And that my friend is how I lost the battle and ruined my life. 


Edit 2: For all the people who think that I made it up and faked it. I literally cried almost every night in the past one year wishing that this is all just a bad dream.

Fair warning: I'm a terrible writer, and I don't want to give a massive life story here, so this will probably be really disjointed. I just feel like I need to talk about this.

I've been depressed off an on for the past six years (mostly on). I turn 22 in July, and I have nothing going on for me. I've never had a job, I don't know how to drive, I don't have a car. I spent two years taking online classes at a community college before dropping out. I'm not an idiot. I understood the lessons and the assignments were easy enough, but I could never bring myself to actually do any of the work. I just felt some *block* in the way every time I tried. Most of highschool went the same way, and I barely managed to graduate. I've had a few girlfriends, but that's rarely gone well. I'm not ugly, overweight, or stupid around girls. But I'm 21 years old and I live in my mom's house, sharing a room with my 17 year old brother. Pretty miserable. I can't tell if I'm in this situation because I'm depressed, or if I'm depressed because I'm in this situation. Maybe it's a bit of both.

I've been having trouble sleeping lately. I usually sleep from 2 to 11 AM, only going to bed once I'm too tired not to. Otherwise, I spend an hour laying in bed thinking about how hopeless things are. I've been trying to find a job, but I'm limited to everything within walking distance (no friends/family to drive me around). That wouldn't be so bad, but I live in a little 2000-population town with nothing big nearby. I've applied around, but been turned away (lack of experience mostly). It's incredibly stressful, because it takes a monumental amount of effort to wake up early (for me, anyway), make myself look nice, and walk along main street (which we live on) looking for places to apply/asking about my applications. 

Anyway, like I said, I'm a bad writer. I wanted to talk about today, but there's some of the background I guess. My brother and sister normally walk home from school, but today my brother had detention (for being tardy too much), and my mother has to work all day... Leaving me responsible for picking her up. No problem, I guess, except the general anxiety I get from going out. So the night before, I went to bed early... Only to discover that one of our cats had peed on my bed. Great. Nothing new though, they've been doing it for about a week now, and we haven't been able to get them to stop. They're litter-trained and we have 3 boxes for 5 cats, but two of them just don't seem to care half the time. So I had to stumble around in the dark (quietly, since my brother was sleeping) for new bed clothes and to clean the mess. Couldn't find anything, so I slept on the couch.

I woke up just as my mother was leaving for work. Before she leaves, she mentions that our trashcans had been blown across the street. Trash pick up was this morning, and it's been extremely windy lately. Anyway, I got dressed, fixed my bed up, and went outside to deal with that. The trashcans were easy to gather up, but the lids had been blown off too, at least 20 yards down the road both ways. Keep in mind, I live right on main street, so chasing those down involved dipping in and out of traffic. Someone was nice enough to yell ""FAGGOT"" out of their ""rich asshole mobile"" (I don't know shit about car models, I just know it was a nice car). Pretty nice to hear when you're already feeling like shit. Anyway, I finished dealing with that first world problem and went inside, ready to lay down and relax... But wait, there's more! I walk into my room to see one of our cats taking the most godawful dump on my nicest blanket. Now, as one might have gathered, I'm a poor motherfucker, so I have very few nice things. I have a pretty decent computer and that's about it. Of course, the deed was done, and the cat just ran off with me standing there trembling with rage. For the first time in a while, I wasn't upset, or just a little mad, or depressed. I was *angry*.

Now, I'm a pretty typical nerdy guy. Wouldn't hurt a fly, and generally pretty quiet. Hell, I have a hard time bringing myself to talk above an ""indoor voice"" even if I'm among friends. But not today. For what felt like a very long time, I just stood there, picturing myself walking into the middle of the street and blowing my brains out as people honked their horns and drove past. I didn't want to hurt anyone, I wanted to stop hurting. The more I write about today, the more I realize my reasons seem insignificant... But it's the tiniest things that build up until the dam finally breaks. For a long time now, I've thought that I'll probably kill myself someday. Maybe in a year, five years, ten, fifty. But today, it was no longer ""someday"", it was ""right now"". I wanted to stop living. I no longer cared about seeing the series finale of House, waiting for the next season of Breaking Bad or Dexter, playing WoW with my friends, seeing what cool games come out next year, going back to school, or trying to meet a nice girl. I wanted to die. I didn't care about how much pain it would bring the people who think they're ""close"" to me. I *wanted* my friends to have to come to my funeral, and know that I wasn't just being a bitch when I talked to them about my depression. I wanted everyone who ever brushed my feelings off to realize how fucked up I really feel inside. 

But I couldn't do a damn thing about it. We don't have a gun. I don't want to slash my wrists and bleed out. I don't think I could even manage to OD right. Jumping into traffic would just put me in the hospital. There are no bridges high enough to commit suicide from. I could steal a gun, but I'd probably get caught before I could do anything. Instead, I picked up a chair, tossed it across the room (thankfully it didn't damage anything) and screamed. I had no words to say, I just screamed louder than I'd ever done before. This was 5 hours ago, and my throat is still a little sore. I went on for several minutes, only stopping when I realized the neighbors might hear, freak out, and call the cops, giving me more to deal with. I didn't cry. I didn't make a phone call, or text someone (&gt;implying I have a cell phone). I didn't walk to the corner store and buy a treat. I picked up my chair, put it back at my desk, and got on Reddit as if nothing happened. In the past four hours, I've done nothing special or new. I don't have some sudden urge to change my life. 

I'm not sure how I feel about that. I don't think I want to kill myself now, though I'm not far from those thoughts (I never am). But today, I had every intention of killing myself as quickly and painlessly as possible, but couldn't. I think that's important. I think that's terrifying.

I'm sorry for rambling so much. My only goal with this was to share. I have (almost) no one I can comfortably talk to. My friends avoid discussing my depression, and when we do talk about it, it's limited to bullshit like ""do ___ and you'll feel better"" or ""you have ___ and ____ going on, you have no reason to be depressed"". The few people I can talk to, I talk to so much about the issue... I don't want to burden them, you know? I don't want to be *that guy* who only talks about how miserable he is.

I really want to be happy, but I don't know how. Everything I see tells me I should ""find something I like"" or ""follow my dreams"". I have no dreams, I have no goals. I'm not exceptionally good at anything. I can draw decently, I'm ""okay"" at programming... but I don't care about either skill enough to want a career out of it. Or maybe I do, but I'm too depressed to tell. Spending time with family doesn't make me feel better, and my friends are growing more distant. That's not their fault - they're in college, working, meeting girls, making new friends, etc. I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to go to school again, but my family is poor. I'd get a job and go to school, but then I wouldn't have time to do the few things I'd enjoy, and I'd be too stressed out. 

Sorry about the wall of text. Thanks so much for reading, if you made it this far. Have a good one.

Edit: Sorry about the slow replies. Like I said, I share a room. I didn't want my brother looking over my shoulder and freaking out or something. Thanks again for your time. ",suicide

203936,"Fiance and I broke up and I already feel like I am deadI've been depressed for as long as I can remember and finally started to get help with it along with other issues a few years ago. The past few months have probably been the worst of it all and until a few days ago I had my fiance to rely on. I know that I shouldn't rely on my ex-fiance as much as I did, but now that he is gone I just feel like ending it all. 

We broke up after drifting apart because I'm always too sad and he doesn't know how to deal with that besides getting angry at me for being self-depreciating. I've been in many unhealthy relationships before meeting him almost 4 years ago where I was told I that I was never good enough, I was ugly, and that no one would ever actually care about me. I've always had low self-esteem because of these relationships paired with the fact that most of my relationships ended because I caught them cheating on me. 

I trust people fairly easily even after being hurt so many times and continue to be hurt because I never seem to learn. I have almost no friends and I don't want to bother the few who do stick around with my issues. 

This past Christmas I got super depressed and checked myself into a hospital to be put on suicide watch after an occasion where my ex-fiance got mad at me for being sad and stopped talking to me while I was visiting him on his day off. I got really hurt and packed my things and said I was going home, but called a Lyft to take me to the hospital since I haven't been able to drive with my everchanging medication cocktail.

The week I spent in there was so lonely and my ex-fiance and best friend seemed so disappointed in me for choosing the hospital instead of talking to them, but it's hard when I am constantly feeling like I'm a bother to them. I try hard not to inconvenience anyone and I just felt like even more of a failure so I tried to pretend I was okay so I could get released. 

Pretending worked for a few weeks, but then it just became unbearable and I kept wanting to go back to stop inconveniencing everyone again. My visits with my ex-fiance got worse and worse. I could feel him get more and more distant through messaging and spending time with him. He started playing league of legends when I was around and I would lie on his bed and watch or look at my phone while he played multiple games alone. I felt so ignored, but being the messed up person I am, I thought that things were okay because at least I could see him once or twice a week and as long as I was around him I felt better. 

I feel like I am rambling too much and I'll try to get to my point soon I promise. I want to check myself into a hospital again, but I'm scared of the disappointment that will come from my roommate/best friend and my family. They think that I was getting better and I kept lying to myself and them thinking that everything would be okay. I hate that I am letting one person who couldn't take the time to comfort me when I needed it most define the pain I am feeling and I hate that I can't be happier or be more like the woman I was when we first met. 

Last night was easy to get to bed because I just kept crying until I passed out, but tonight is a nightmare. I cried myself to sleep, but ended up waking up because of a nightmare. My brain is on full speed and telling me that I am worthless and replaying all the good moments and things leading to the breakup. I know that time will make things easier, but right now I am at the lowest point I have ever been and just wish that I could die in my sleep and not wake up to this nightmare where he is gone anymore. 

I don't know what I need, but I don't really have anyone to talk to since I push everyone away with my sadness. I just need to get through tonight and then focus on the next day and then repeat it over and over until I am either numb to this pain or my medication cocktail starts to work.

I'm in my late twenties and still living at home with her because I took care of her when she was sick/I was in school, and she took care of me after I had major surgery.  I commute to a job an hour away in a dead small town, and all of my friends moved away to the nearest big city. I haven't moved out of my house because I don't feel secure enough in my job to commit elsewhere financially. I can't find a job in the area where all of my friends are, and even if I did, I think my fear of changing and ending up somewhere worse would scare me off.

I have a fair amount of friends, but I'm lonely and don't think I'll ever find someone to share my life with. I don't know who would want to anyway, I'm self-conscious, terrified of everything and don't think I'm attractive enough for anyone.

I've been single for almost five years now and I'm tired of the aching loneliness and the inevitable sting of rejection when I try to fill it. (Edit: I did have a relationship with I guy I thought I'd be with forever.  He left me and there has been no one since.  I've known great love, so I know exactly what I'm missing.)

I don't find joy in anything anymore. I've tried living, tried to improve my life and work towards a better future, but every time I try I fail, and it's wearing me down.  Every day is agony to me.  I cant enjoy the brief moments of happiness that come my way because I know they won't last. I've done therapy, medications, exercise, healthy eating, affirmations, more socializing, new hobbies, traveling, everything and anything that has been prescribed or suggested to me.  Nothing is making living less painful for me. The only tangible relief I get comes from self-harming, which makes me feel like a pathetic cliché and garbage person,  not to mention it broke my mother's heart when she found out I was doing it.

I know I will be missed,  I know my death will affect people greatly.  I am a very well-liked person, but I don't think I can live for them anymore. It's not enough.",suicide

203959,"Weekend is upcoming, so is my deathWell, that's it folks, I've been planning this for long time, I'm here not because of instinct of self-preservation, I'm here just to spend some time on posting, since I don't have anything to do. Been lurking reddit for quite some time, thought it's nice to come here and maybe join the community for first &amp; only time. 

So, yes, the weekend is coming so is the hotel room already booked, been looking for so many various options not to mess this up and I've been doing some serious research - in the end I think my method will give me 100% success rate, unless I'm going to be found within an hour after drinking something - not going to tell you what substance I'm going to use, but all I need is an hour or two to end this fucking misery and make sure that even if by some miracle I'm going to be found, it's going to be pointless to carry on with cpr since I'll be brain dead af. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, back to business, I know that people who are depressed are probably struggling time and again with suicidal thoughts, sufferring from number of mental issues and it's probably the easiest way to choose - just die, like a coward. But, I honestly I couldn't care less, I don't have anyone I can rely on, don't have friends, my dad died years ago, I don't have anyone in so-called family I can rely on, I don't even have any 'connection' with them - it's not like, I was abandoned or something, but they don't give a shit about me, and so do I. Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive, been unemployed for long time and been doing some gigs here and there just so I can provide barely for myself. I don't know who's gonna burry me, but I don't give a fuck anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are always some options, I'm still quite young, 28 is not certainly the age you give want to die, probably I could somehow carry on, but it's just pointless, time and again I've been 'there' - I mean, picking up the pieces and moving on - not this time. I've made too many fuck up in my life, been struggling with regrets badly. Trying to put this all behind - didn't work, at least I don't have anyone who have to rely on me, I don't have kids which is a relief, noone really depend on me. It's right time to go - that's for sure.

Today she was sent in emergency to a Veterinary college in our state and I took her the three hours out there under a lot of false promises. They said after accepting her it would be thousands more dollars than they told me this morning. I've sold my camper and took a loan on my car to put the downpayment on her surgery, but they want even more tomorrow or they won't treat her. They won't release her with a balance, even if I could get only the gas to drive the three hours back to the college, I can't even have her with me at the end.

204002,"Totally crippling anxiety and incompetenceFor someone of supposedly normal intelligence, I have an incredible combination of no common sense, severe anxiety, and incompetence.

Very long story but after a lot of ups and downs I find myself in my 40s, with no money, a huge resume gap, and no ability to pay the bills.  I spent a decade accumulating and then losing a large amount of money with options trading and have nothing to show for it.

I recently took a job that pays (almost) enough for me to support myself, but I would continue slipping farther into credit card debt.  The problem is I cannot possibly make it even another week.  Every minute in the day has to be accounted for in a spreadsheet in order to get paid.  No matter how hard I try I cannot keep up to date.  Someone will come in my office and I'll forget to track for a while.  It's a supported employment job, where you try to find work for people and then help train them to maintain employment.  I thought it would be the answer to my problems, mainly that I feel I've had all the advantages in life and squandered them and contributed nothing to society.  I haven't been there a month and I've already discovered there's no way to make it.  I love the clients themselves but I simply cannot keep on track with the administrative part.  Hundreds of forms, the time sheets, everything.  Having to account for every second of your day in detail.  Other people can do it, I cannot.  I cannot imagine any kind of job I can do.  Maybe a toll booth collector (I know those have mostly been automated) or something similar, although that would probably require 70-80 hours a week.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a mystery to me.  I am completely incompetent and unable to deal with stress, administrative tasks and heavy technology use.  I am on the brink of losing this job, it's not a question of effort or wanting to help the clients.  I literally cannot do it.  When that happens, as I haven't been there long enough to collect unemployment, I'll either be homeless or looking for family to live with.  I'm sure this sounds whiny and self-absorbed, and it is.

204008,"I'm very worried about my best friend.Hello everyone, I'm a 33 year old swedish man and my best friend told me last night that he's probably gonna kill himself after Infinity War and Game of Thrones is over, this obviously worries me very very much, when he said it i talked and listened to him for about 1 hour and i think our little conversation was great and i think it helped him very much. Me and him have been best friends since we were 4 years old, we've been in the same kindergarden, same elementary school, same high school, same gymnasium (Which is basically swedish version of college) and we've now both been working with eachother as carpenters since we were about 19 i think, so we are very close friends, we play video games and things like that together everyday, although he will never come out with me and my other friends because we drink alcohol since his dad was an alcoholic when he was young and i respect that very much.

I might have gotten a little off topic there but here's alot of what he told me last night.

He started by saying just saying that he might kill himself after GoT is finished since he has nothing else to look forward to, he later explained how he feels so lonely and that hes a virgin still which really brakes my heart because this guy would make an excellent partner for a woman, he's a very nice and caring guy, he's probably the funniest guy i've ever met,He goes to the gym everyday and he's really really strong, got really big muscles and all that, he's 6'4 aswell, he's very protective of the women in his life (Mother and Sisters) and he's very very masculine, although that might be a bad thing nowadays from what i hear but i guess women might get a primal attraction from that anyway i dont know. He's got tattoos all over his body including a very small one next to his eye which is an X, a couple on his head aswell, he got inspiration from [this](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/853845649148230182/85A8E31667D18DF5E1C31F4E59ACAE785BD71E14/) photo of Ragnar, he has very similar tattoos, he even has a scar like him on the eye there, he resembles Ragnar very much.

He wakes up everyday, showers and brushes his teeth, makes breakfast, gets our 'company car' (not sure what its called in english) drives over to me and we drive over to whoever has hired us for carpenting help.He's lived alone and just worked for 13 years straight. I've taken vacations alot since we earn very much money from this, he's never even taken one. I've asked him about that and he said that if he doesn't work then women won't like him which is obviously not true but he doesn't listen to me and he just works anyway, and i think that hurts him very much because everyone needs to rest! I don't know how he got such a motivation to work because when we were in gymnasium me and him would always arrive late and skip school and stuff like that.

He also has a little hobby of making rap instrumental stuff, like beats or whatever its called and he's even made it to a couple mainstream songs on spotify, i won't say his name obviously in respect of his privacy.

One thing that i think he contributed to his bad mental health/suicidal thoughts is the fact that he went to prison for 4 months because he badly beat down 2 guys that tried to rob his sisters, i was there with him and we were looking for his sisters because we lost them in the big crowd and when we found them they were getting robbed by 2 guys and 1 of them had a knife (which is where he got that scar on his eye i talked about) and he directly knew what was going on and he instantly just ran towards them and he tackled one of them down who he punched in the brutally punched in the face 5-6 times and the other guy had the knife and he got stabbed in the arm and that little cut in the eye he got, then he headbutted the guy and smashed his face in, screaming loud as fuck while he did it ''DONT TOUCH MY FUCKING SISTERS'' but in swedish obviously. We were maybe 24 when that happend, his sisters were a little older than him, i dont know the age all i know is that he's their little brother.

Another thing he told me is how no girl will like him because of how scary he looks, bald with a full beard with the scar and tattoos. He said that whenever he's close to a school or any area that has kids all the kids run away because he's so scary looking, he likes kids alot and it hurts him when that happens. He lives right outside a place where kids play football alot and when the ball bounces out and goes to him on his porch all the kids get scared and it hurts him alot.

He's done alot of cries for help before but i never took them seriously which makes me feel very bad, he got a tattoo on his neck not long ago which says ''Fortis in foras In medio confringetur'' (that might not be the exact translation i just took that out of google translate) it's basically latin for ''Strong on the outside Broken on the inside''

Sorry if i just randomly talked about him sometimes, it probably wasn't helpful to the situation but i've always looked up to my best friend and i like talking about him because he's like an idol for me!

Everything I say will feel like a movie and that I'm lying but all I have to say is that this is all true... I will post this rant on this subreddit and r/depression. This will most likely not get read so I feel like there's no use even writing this long rant... 

I don't know where to start... I'm 13 years old... and I'm already planning to go on a mass murder at my school and commit suicide afterwards... I truly don't know what I am doing... I haven't seen a psychologist and will not so I am not diagnosed with depression or being a psychopath actually... 

I feel guility but not at the same time for the fact that I planned to commit mass murder at my school... I feel like a monster... Thinking about killing others... I think society will be much better if I, a psychopath, was gone... I don't know why I plan on murdering and that makes me concerned for myself... I have already drawn the layout of my school and drew a plan of where I am going to kill in order... 

It is so hard to fit in society... I can't seem to tell if what I said is rude or offensive therefore everyone thinks I am a rude person. And I always unintentionally get into arguments on social media and lose them thus everyone thinks I am stupid. I have been bullied since 9 years old about being overweight and having pimples. I have been told I'm ugly and I think I am ugly... Why am I even still here just to get insulted? 

Just now I literally took a knife from my kitchen and pointed it at my chest... Unfortunately, I pussied out. I'm such a pussy, I can't do anything, I hate myself... Somehow I managed to hide my depression as my friends think I am very extroverted and my teachers think I am a cheerful teenager... 

Nowadays, I have sudden episodes of having visions and thoughts in my head of killing my schoolmates, teachers, and myself afterwards. And I start to imagine my hands covered in blood. From what I noticed, drinking water or eating something will stop these hallucinations, when I go to the tap to drink water I imagine that the water coming out of the tap is blood... All this will sound fake but I am legit experiencing these hallucinations. 

I really don't need to your guys support or encouragement and please don't tell me to see a psychologist...

204047,"All the horrible shit on my conscience right now, every day is a battle.  

Basically I'm a 15 year old male, and everyday is a struggle. I've got some horrible things on my conscience and I'm not deserving of any kind of sympathy I know, even if maybe I am looking for it. I don't know how long this post is going to be because I'm going to type what I have on my conscience right now.

I was messing around with my little 5 year old sister, we were just boxing and lightly punching each other and when I lightly jabbed her in the chest, I felt like a sex offender and feel like I did it because I wanted to touch her up or something. I'm honestly so scared and feel like a horrible person.

Whilst I was having sex with my girlfriend, I think I came inside her on purpose. When I say this, I mean as in getting to the point of the start of cumming (pushing it as far as possible) and then pulling out. Meaning that maybe the first bit of cum went inside her. I understand this was stupid and I don’t know why I did it and I’ve also spoken to her about it and she wasn’t mad, but I feel really guilty. Maybe I was just pushing my luck I don’t know, but I have bad anxiety and now I’m panicking that it’s sexual assault or something.

I was masturbating the other night, when I came across a friend’s snapchat story, with a picture of his dead sister(who is like 5) captioned “I miss you”. I’m pretty sure I felt guilty for even viewing this whilst I was doing what I was doing, and furthermore I think I had a sexual thought about it. My heart aches. I don’t even remember the facts anymore. I feel like I tried to push it out of my head. But maybe I didn’t. Maybe it got me off. I don’t know how I can ever live with myself after this. I’m disgusting. I'm not even attracted to kids or anything like that.

Something that happened with my girlfriend, we were in bed and I was rubbing her ass, and eventually I was rubbing her clit area, I don't think I actually fingered her but maybe I did I don't even know anymore. At this point she had fallen asleep. I don't think I was even aware that she had fallen asleep until she 'woke up', but again I don't know, I guess I never do. I felt so horrible and told her what happened. She told me it was okay and that I didn't violate any of her boundaries. We then established some boundaries, and this leads me onto my next misdeed.

Once again, I was in bed with my girlfriend, this time it was early in the morning and I'm pretty sure I was still half asleep. I had my eyes shut and then I felt her giving me head. I opened my eyes and she wasn't, she was turned around, facing the other way presumably asleep. Now I don't understand why I felt that, was it a dream? I really don't know, but then I had a thought that maybe I was fucking her whilst she was sleeping. This thought ripped me apart and I know that it seems unlikely but my brain really wants me to believe it. And I guess sometimes I do. I feel horrible. I told my girlfriend about this too, and she said that it didn't happen. She said that she would have woken up and it just all sounds like a complete long shot. She said that even if it did happen, she isn't hurt and she doesn't care whatsoever. My brain can't accept this. The fact that I don't know what truly happened is killing me, so I am just assuming the worst and my brain keeps adding more complexities to the situation that further criminalise me. Maybe I did put my dick inside her purposefully, I can't remember any of it and it's making me hate myself.

I also feel horrible for some thoughts that I have, unspeakable thoughts. Thoughts about incest, rape, and more fucked up shit. Nothing I'd ever do. And I know for sure I would never do these things with intent, but the thoughts make me feel so horrible. I truly believe I'm a disgusting person.

Another thing that happened, My sister, who is thirteen (nearly fourteen), was lying on her front in the middle of the floor. As I was going past, I stomped on her foot a few times (not hard, just messing around I guess) and her ass moved. I looked. I feel so disgusting. Why would I even look at my sister like that. It's fucking disgraceful. Maybe I did it knowing her ass would move. It doesn't matter. I'm a freak either way.

I also hit my girlfriend once. She was sat on top of me and as I sat up or moved or whatever, I hit her. Now I'm pretty sure it was an accident. But again my brain convinces me otherwise and maybe it wasn't. I cried pretty much straight away, It upset me because she's been through so much and I don't want to cause her pain. She's the most amazing girl and she's been here for me through absolutely everything, no matter what, she's never left my side. She's a blessing to this cruel world.

Yesterday, I was struggling so I decided to text a helpline. I texted to the woman for a bit and I was on my computer at the same time, I think at one point tho (whilst I was on my computer and waiting for responses), I got in one of those moods and I ended up having a wank. Now I feel so shitty because what if someone was going to commit suicide and really needed the help but I denied them that and they actually did. I feel so horrible and guilty.

The other day I had a thought and it makes me feel disgusting. The thought was of me fucking my sister and I don't even think it turned me on it was just lingering in my head. At the time I was also really horny and fancied a wank. I got scared because I didn't want to think this thought whilst I did that, I'd have felt really horrible and guilty. I was really horny and I stroked my dick a few times, not even masturbating I guess, but the thought was still in my head at the time. In the end I was too scared and didn't masturbate. Now I can't get over this, and I feel so guilty because I basically thinking about that thought, considering I kind of stroked my dick. It's so wrong and I feel so guilty.",non-suicide

204056,"I'm ending my life tomorrow.Hi. I never thought I'd post on here. I don't even know where to begin. 

I'm 22. I've suffered from depression for as long as I can remember, and have had suicidal thoughts since I was 10. I Believe I have BPD, but it hasn't been diagnosed. I've attempted suicide a handful of times but never succeeded, mostly because I wasn't 100% committed to the idea. 

I don't have a bad life. I'm not close to my family, but we're not estranged either. My parents love me, but didn't really know how to handle my emotional issues and I never got the help I needed when I was a child, so I've been trying to play catch up on my own since I've had access to resources. Medications don't work. Therapy doesn't work. Meditation doesn't work. Healthy diet and exercise doesn't work. I'm at a loss for what to do. 

I was bullied severely as a child and I thought, once that stopped, I'd be happy. But I wasn't. Then I was fighting with my parents all the time, and I thought once I moved out and went to college, I'd be happy. I wasn't. I went to school for 3 years but then dropped out because my depression got In the way. I lost all my friends and my apartment and I recently had to move back home.

Since the beginning of this year, I've moved back in with my parents, my car has broke down for the third time, I've started a miserable job I'll probably be stuck in the rest of my life, and worst of all, this week I lost my best friend of 7 years. She was the most important person in my life. My soulmate. She's cut off all contact with me and I don't blame her. I was so motivated at the start of this year to be a better person but without her by my side, I don't want to be anything. All the color has drained from the world. I can't eat. I can't sleep. And it's not her fault I feel this way. It's the realization that I'm such a terrible person that the best friend I've ever known, who's been there through thick and thin, who just the night before she stopped talking to me was telling me how everything was going to be okay, could completely cut me off. I hurt her so bad that all the promises of our future together are no more. And I cannot forgive myself for that. 

I'm going to make an exit bag, but a real shitty one since I have no car to go get supplies. I only have stores I can walk to available to me. I just so happened to find out I have the day off work tomorrow, so my parents will leave me at home alone before they go off to work. I'll then go pick up my supplies and come home and hopefully within the hour I'll be gone. 

I don't know why I'm writing this out. I guess I want to tell someone. It seems weird to die and just not say goodbye. So. Goodbye. If it doesn't work or I change my mind, I'll update by Saturday night and let everyone know. If I don't update, you'll know it worked. 

I just want to urge anyone out there who's thinking of suicide... please, don't do it. I know I sound like a hypocrite but one day everything's going to work out for you, no matter what you're dealing with. The world wouldn't be the same without you in it. I'm sure after I'm gone, there will be people who will wish I hadn't done it. But I'm being selfish. I don't want to suffer anymore. Don't make my same mistake.

I've been trying to help him for over a year now. whenever he said he was going to commit suicide, I've always talked him out of it each time, and it was successful. but this time, I can't. I've suggested a therapist, but he refuse to get therapy after one an extremely horrible experience at a mental facility. he decided to commit suicide after he found out that two of he best friends cut them off and said that they hated him over an argument that involved whether he cared about them or not. (plus some other things). reason for is, my friend overreacted to something very little, and thought it indicated that their friends hated them and decided to cut them off first, but says it is because he is sensitive. he's been cutting more, and I don't know what to do. I've tried to stop him, but it doesn't work. 

**this detail will be important for the next paragraph**

I may also add that he is a trans male. additionally, my other friend talked to me about it, and he said transgender people have the higher rate for suicide. I've looked it up and it seems to be true. aside that, he says it's possible that it's so high because of how transgender people see theirselves, and how they are dissatisfied with theirselves. and he also told me how they possibly might believe that changing genders may fix the dissatisfaction. **note this is how he sees it, remember that.** 

my friend, the suicidal one, has told me multiple times which they don't feel like a girl. that's it, I didn't know how to comment on that because I'm not transgender, and never have been. 

anyways, he's fixated on his birthday where he will commit suicide, I tried to talk him out of bit, but he has fully convinced himself that he will do it. 

I've tried helping him so many times, but I'm just tired at this point. he's just getting worse, and it's obvious he needs professional help, but refuses to get it, and keeps hurting himself. 

he has told me multiple times that nobody cares about him, nobody cares to stop him, nobody will care if he commits suicide, and that he's a mistake, trash, useless, pathetic, etc. I DO NOT mean to rant, but I just find what he told me just.. I guess annoying, the fact that nobody will stop him? I've tried, I've done seriously everything I can, but he's just getting worse, and I have decided to try to come to reddit for any help.

he just rejects the help, or just ignores some of the help I try to offer. such as, sometimes, I try to help him and he'll most likely ignore it, and switch the topic to something else that involves his depression. I just find that somewhat.. suspicious? but that's just me.

While it's harder for someone AFAB like me, it is possible, and since I live in Manhattan and have a supportive family it is something I am able to do. 

Since this is a very taboo surgery I am worried about how it'll effect my chances of getting a girlfriend. My current gf/crush is already disappointed about me being afab (I look very androgynous so I don't think she knew at first). I'm worried any girls I meet in the future will be horrified by my body once I don't have genitals.

And yet here I am again, thinking about suicide. If I'm honest, I think about it even when I'm not at my lowest, but now I've actively taken steps towards it. I'm tying up all my loose ends. The only thing I don't know is how I'm going to do it or if I can actually go through with it. I can't see an alternative. I don't want to live another 50 or 60 years like this. No the fleeting moments when I feel relatively good aren't worth staying alive for. I've run out of options.",suicide

There’s no one there that really cares or someone I can talk to , not even my family they’ll just use it against me or undermine my issues because “they had it worse “ so fucking what you had it worse it doesn’t mean I don’t have it bad . If you raise someone to be soft they will be soft. Basically shitty parents who I can’t talk to .

My friends , most of them are fake they chat shit behind my back but to my face nothing and think I’m dumb and don’t notice anything but it’s cool just letting me know who my real friends are and what friendships not to invest in .
I have 2 genuine friends in my life but each of them has their on problems and I don’t want to be one to burden them with my shitty life and problems .

My ex helped me when I was down but it showed her I’m vulnerable which came back to me and fucked me over

204075,"So I read through r/collapse late last night and now I feel like the only way out of a life of misery and suffering is just to do myself in now.I've had a long history of suicidal ideation and attempts, as well as severe depression and anxiety since my early teens. And that still kind of keeps me stuck in a shitty life -- I have only a handful of not very close friends, no relationships, poor ties with family, a crappy job, and a pointless art degree and career that pretty much makes me useless to the world.

And now r/collapse has made it clear to me that what I deal with now will probably be the best time of my life, compared to a future of suffocating and starving slowly in a fascist government. And all I can do is just watch in helpless solitude as everything goes up in flames.  A few posts even talked up suicide as a positive thing in such a situation.

That was late last night and I had some nightmares -- like the kind where you wake up in a cold sweat repeatedly. I feel completely fucked.

Honestly I'm just a waste of oxygen and resources. I'm not really worth anyone's time as I am now. And everything just seems to helpless and my life has been hell anyway. I'm sitting here with a bottle of ibuprofin that I was going to down. I chickened out and ate only five and got scared. Deep down I really don't want to do this but I feel like there's no other option.

204079,"Pointless.My belief system is ruining my life, for the record i'm 19 and about to go to university(i live in poland). I was always fascinated with science and that led to me trying to learn a lot about our universe, i started watching youtube video's explaining all the basic stuff to our universe, all the laws of physics, the quantum world, the entropy and the more i digged the more cold the world seemed to me. I'm an agnostic so a theory of god giving the world pupouse doesn't speak to me well. Eventually i started looking at all the emotions as chemical reacions, all our desires driven by primitive dopamine based systems in our brain, life is cold, it has no sparkle to it, we don't really know what's it's purpose, maybe it's just to increase entropy, who knows. So i started playing around with drugs(benzos and opiates) because they made me feel good, because that's what my stupid brain told me he wants and there was one moment when i mixed the benzos with alcohol and passed out for 4 hours, completely blank, i ""wake up"" in front of my computer not knowing what i was just doing. That's when something changed, i realised how easy it is to just end it, i was pretty sure i was on the verge of overdosing. Why end it though? Is nothingness better then pointlessness? I don't know the answers to those questions, but i know that i have some reasons to end it, for one i don't think i'll be able to handle living on my own and the university itself, i don't want to see my parents age, i don't want to think about that one girl i had something going with 4 years ago.

204084,"Is is worth it anymore?Currently sitting in a random parking lot in my car because I feel like I dont belong anywhere. I already suffer from anxiety and depression. Was on anti anxiety meds but just dropped off on taking them about 4ish months ago. I've hit a really bad low point today and honestly thought about all the ways of ending it. I guess I'm just too nice because others rely on me or im just not strong enough?  I broke off a 4 year relationship because I fell out of love with her, we'll call her M. I fell out for another person who I still deeply have feeling for that was in a polygamous relationship with us for about 8 months, we'll call her K. Me and M I guess you could say mutually broke it off since she felt the same way of the relationship feeling more platonic then romantic. I still care and love M, just in no romantic ways at all. K and I have had hopeful conversations about future relations because we both came clean about feeling we still have for each other. Today it hurt with finding out shes unofficially with a mutual friend. It hurt in indescribable ways honestly. Our conversation today still had talk of hope in the future and feeling haven't changed from what it sounded like. Just obstacles and hurt and uncaring feelings concerning others that know us. I already feel like I put my peace to the side to make others feel okay and to always help them in anyway I can. And im questioning if I should just go all together. Like the end. I know its not the right answer but I've been dealing with that thought for a while on and off. And today just really pushed me over the edge into that pit. I dont want to post to social and make it seem like im seeking attention. I dont feel like I have anyone to talk to. No support system in existence for me on this shit. Im tired of holding back and faking a smile. I just can never bring myself to be an asshole and hurt the people I care about with an outburst. Idk im weak and naive I guess. I just feel like everything is worthless right now. I went from being numb all the time to just extremely painful today and I dont see an end in sight unless its a bullet honestly. Hell I have K and M as my best friends, I have a few really close friends but I can't talk to them for mutual feelings and they seem all so close to the subject that I know it'll just make me finally hit that wall and end it. Im ranting here amd just done with all of this shit and the feeling of not good enough in anything I do or anyone Im around. Its not even bearable anymore and it just hurts. Idk why im even posting this. To feel better? To get it somewhere so its off my chest? To tell the truth im not seeing a light anywhere. At least not until much much later or I make the choice to end it. Hell if they ever found this it wouldn't be hard to know its about them and I hope if you are reading just know im not seeking sympathy or attention because it hurt. Im genuinely looking for an answer. There's so much of the actual situation that I can't really say or bring myself to explain atm. I just dont know anymore. I know what I want and she knows that but im not sure I have the strength to keep trying to explain to her that it doesn't matter what others fucking think or say no matter who they fucking are.

But ever since I made the first attempt on my life, I have been unable to shake the feeling that one day, suicide will take me. I have been through bouts of severe depression for around the past 7-8 years. And I find myself asking things like, 'At what point might it be considered ""justified""?' After a decade? Maybe three decades? How long do I have to keep suffering chronically, consistantly getting worse each time for people/society to think. Ok, I guess he's had enough now. I guess I'm just tired, tired of thinking that I'm selfish for wanting or thinking I'd be better off gone. Tired of being told ""Oh, but it gets better"". Tired of being told those close to me would be upset. Tired of seeing those around me succeed and move forward with their lives, while I remain stagnant, a burden on society. So mentally unwell and sensitive I can hardly think about working. If that doesn't make me a failure, I don't know what does.

I don't think I deserve help or happiness. I feel like garbage. 
I have thought of suicide multiple time times. I am really scared of hospitals. I don't want it go wrong and suffer even more. I am on medications, (sertraline, clonazepam) but it just makes me numb to everything. I don't remember what happiness felt like.
One day I decided to go ahead and swallow the entire stripfull of clonazepam. I would fall asleep and that would be it. Had my roommate not been there coincidentally at the apartment, I might have gone through with it. It scares me that I came so close.
Each day just passes by. I am at risk of losing my job any day now. I can no longer sit and work on something for more than half an hour.

204133,"A dilemma of constant fearYou can call me Joshua. I'm currently at the age of 14 and I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was 9 years old. My life has constantly been at war with itself of where to go with major decisions of what I want to do. I already have a plan, I already know what day is would be on, and I've attempted to talking with others about my constant struggles. I've been seeing a therapist since I was in the 5th grade though recently I feel it's becoming more unreliable as some of our main talking points are referring to small events and disciplinary actions rather than mental help/education or domestic problems. I would also like to mention that I have a sister, but I've had fear of her ever since she was 13 and began to physically abuse me since I was 5. 

The physical abuse may have set the building blocks for my other issues that I'll get to in one second. Back in the 5th grade, I was also diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Asperger's Syndrome. Few years later, I was tested to officially see if I had these disorders that the Public School system claimed I had. I was ranked above average in nearly every subject I was tested in for my age and confirmed that, ""Yes, Joshua does have these disorders."" I was prescribed with Methylphenidate (Concerta) and eventually upgraded to Adderall. By the time I was prescribed with the Adderall, I attended a private school out of the state due to bullying confrontations at the public school.

The day I took the Adderall was when my depression and anxiety really took hold in my judgmental conscious about the possibility of suicide. I wrote a suicide note, stating I would end my life on May 29th, 2015 due to an overdose of the Adderall. I showed it to three of my friends; David, Joe, and Gabriel. Though all were greatly concerned for my well-being, Gabriel told his parents about the suicide attempt and eventually staff &amp; faculty at the private school. 

On May 20th, the guidance consular, nurse, and both principals, decided to confront me about the suicide attempt and decided to summarize: kick me out of the school until I was confirmed to be not suicidal. Later that night, I was sent to the ER for suicidal tendencies and placed on the suicide watch for about 3 hours until I was escorted to a another hospital with an adolescent program for troubled children. Stayed there for 6 days and was prescribed Escitalopram (Lexapro). 

I fear to take Escitalopram because of the nausea symtoms, I fear to tell my parents, the suicide lifeline, and anyone of a remote amount of authority due to the trauma I experienced when placed on suicide watch. I've been so content on taking my own life that I set my voice mail on my cell phone as a suicide threat, and it feels that everything is being controlled under what society thinks is ""best"" for me. 

I'm just beginning to get into high school and I stress and fear that any day I'll just lose it and I'll have to let my body just rest. It's a crossroad that has infinite amount of paths that none seem appealing to go with following. I'm just a useless adolescent that doesn't that's completely in shambles and ends spending nearly the whole time as a hermit.

204135,"The ""It Gets Better"" FallacyOften times when one learns of a friend's depression or suicidal tendencies, the first thing to come out of his/her mouth is ""it gets better,"" meaning that while life may appear difficult in the present, it will get easier as time goes on.  This phrase is often uttered before the individual speaking it has a complete understanding of the depressed/suicidal person's current situation or beliefs.  The truth is that in many cases, life doesn't get any easier, but this statement is used in a vain attempt to try and help the person without putting in any real effort.  The number of times I've heard the aforementioned phrase is immense, but in my personal experience, it is simply untrue.  I am not claiming that everyone who is depressed or suicidal will continue being so, but rather expressing that in my particular scenario, my life has not gotten any better in the past decade and does not appear to do so anytime in the foreseeable future.  Now, if my life is most likely not going to improve, why continue living it?  I go into further detail in my previous post on this subreddit in regards to my personal views on suicide here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2zvlad/a_numerical_model_for_mood/ .

She's thought about committing suicide before but the last i've heard of it was 6-7 years ago, when we were both in junior high. I'm really at a loss for what to do right now. Please help!

I’m not trying to sound like I’m a good person or anything because trust me I’m not. The thing is that I’ll still try my best to be there if my friend has something they’re going through. I just expect a little empathy from someone if that’s not too much to ask for. I feel like a fucking alien that’s experiencing things that no one understands. Just tell me “I get where you’re coming from and why you feel this way.” That’s REALLY all I want.

From an objective standpoint I have a perfect life and should be happy and carefree; I have no family issues, in fact my family loves me dearly and would do anything for me at a moments notice. I have lots of friends who love to hang out and laugh with me, even when I don't talk to them for a while they reach out to me every time. I have a beautiful girlfriend who always wants to make me happy and see me smile. I am not ugly by any means and can make friends incredibly easily. My family is wealthy and I will never be financially burdened or in debt because of it, I have just completed university without a cent of debt in my name thanks to them. 

Yet I just.. I just can't seem to be happy anymore with anything, I just don't desire anything at all. Everyday I wake up and I just want to find things to pass the time, I don't want to be anything or anyone. I don't want a family and I don't want to be famous or popular or successful, I just want to be alone. There is absolutely nothing that I desire or want to work towards and because of this I have started to believe that one day I will kill myself. What is the point of anything if you don't want it or can't be happy doing it? Why should I drag on everyday, go to something I don't want to go too and keep pretending like I actually want to live this life. It's just getting harder and harder to be normal with every day that passes.

I can't remember when I started having these thoughts but recently they have just been getting stronger and stronger until finally I had to talk to somebody about it. If I told anybody in my real life that these thoughts were happening I don't think they would believe me or they would overreact but either way they would ever look at me the same.

A lot of the posts I see in this sub I can see a solution too, like people are recently unemployed and broke, been dumped or being bullied which sounds horrible but I can see that time would be able to heal those wounds, yet for me, I already have everything a person could want and I still have to fake being happy, so I can see no solution. My Mum and Grandma both suffer from strong bouts of depression with my Grandma attempting suicide before, so I guess its genetic, and if it's genetic, surely this will never end and there is no hope. The only reason why I haven't done it yet is because I am certain my mother would follow in my footsteps and my whole family would be destroyed, but lately, it's getting harder to fight the thoughts.

204201,"Feeling... LostHello.  


I don't know if this is the right place, but I want to try and vent. I just hope none of my friends read this, because they will know who it is and they have been good to me (at least in their efforts and intents, within their means)  
I am feeling extremely lost in my life. More so than ever before. I have never been happy to be alive, not since I have had an understanding of that concept anyway. When I was younger I felt suicidal occasionally, but it passed. Always. I have just existed and accepted that I exist - whatever.

Now, I am in a low and it seems that I just keep falling further. I haven't had a 'win' in two years. Family deaths, ended relationships, injuries while trying to achieve things. Nothing.

Everything I have worked for has been absolutely zero worth. I used to have some direction, I even got an advanced degree to support that. In essence I was living my life for others, in an attempt to help and I had come to terms with that - all part of the accepting I exist. Not people so much, don't care about them in general\*, but the planet. But after two years I haven't found meaningful work in my field. I cannot understand why, as I never recive feedback on most of the triple figure worth of applications I have submitted. 

When I do get somewhere the feedback is somehow always net positive. I am fed up of explaining to people how that is not a good thing. I am fed up trying to improve on something where I am told there isn't much to improve. I am fed up having no 'success' (i don't care about money, and yes I am priviledged and aware I can say that without concerns).

I live with family. 'Temporarily'. They are simultaneously supportive and the least supportive and most toxic people I have ever faced. Sure I get to live here for free, which I truly appreciate. But that's where it ends. I get attacked, made to feel worthless and everything else on a daily basis. I don't think they even realise - emotional intelligence = 0. I am asked to help with things (not a problem!), but when I am busy or ask for a delay it's not good enough (massive problem). 'Drop everything, and do this for me.' Recently I agreed to help someone out, driving them somewhere. Scheduled my whole week around it. Application deadlines and other commitments in account - all scheduled out. Their prospective plans changed and I got yelled at and called inconsiderate when I asked to stick to the original arrangement as I would otherwise not be able to finish what I was doing in time (glad I stood my ground, as I interviewed - albeit unsuccesfully yet again).

This is where the worst part of the cycle begins. I did something else between my basic and advanced degree. It was ok for a while. I went back to my discipline as I had fresh motivation and a desire to return to the original plan. I swore to myself I wouldn't let myself fall back into mediocracy. I set the bar high, but at that point I felt ok. Not happy, but ok. Confident in my abilities and prospects. I said that the advanced degree would be a way back to the original intent, plan, whatever. I later set the post degree expectation low, any job that is justifyably degree related. I adjusted my degree expectations mid-way as shit started going wrong. I underperformed to my initial goals, but accepted that a range of personal life events and an injury made it harder. I accepted that I had still done objectively well - even if not as well as I had wanted. What I am saying is I have been generous with myself and gave myself every chance to 'succeed'.

And now, nothing. Nothing. Nothing has happened. My life has been at standstill. I volunteer with a bunch of places that are supposed to help me open doors. Nope. I am selling out my integrity in the process, as I hate volunteering (I enjoy the work I do, it's the premise I don't like) and despise that my discipline effectively needs it - it perpetuates the low salaries that sweep the industry, if the low bar for most work is free - not even minimum wage. As I said before, I don't care about the money - but some people desperately need it (again, I realise I am privileged in that sense) and this is becoming a tangent. Don't get me wrong, I am not wealthy per se but far from the breadline due to my family (and partially the aforementioned family deaths).  
When I consider doing 'something else' I end up not sleeping. Googling efficient ways to kill myself, feeling like I failed\*\*. Not failed to meet the high bar I set, but that I have failed to meet the extremely low revised goal. I have no hard preferences, except one. I don't care where it is (I mean, I do have a preference on where but not one that I am trying to enforce. If that makes sense), or what. As long as it specifically degree-related, however spuriously (I think that's reasonable, but maybe it's not. I might add that the common response to telling someone my discipline is surprise that I haven't found anything. It is supposed to be an employable area - albeit not a profitable one). Moving back into a retail/sales type position is the worst possible scenario in my head. I get it, it's important and I value and appreciate those who do it. But I cannot anymore. Stand there and smile, promising to look into an issue that a blind rat (I love rats actually) could see is one they caused themselves. Then reading reviews how you (unnamed, but you reconise their name and/or the situation afterall) were unhelpful, condescending and rude. Fuck that.  Rather be dead than deal with that shit on a daily basis again - I don't have the strength that other people do.

And here lies the problem. I mentioned at the beginning that I felt suicidal in my teens but it always passed. I used to think I had good mental strength. I could work through anything eventually - happily providing a shoulder for those who needed it as well. Gave me a purpose even, I suppose. I didn't mind. For a year now, I have avoided being the support person I was known for - or that I strived to be at least. I hate that, I cannot even be a friend to my friends - because all I want to do is rant and rave about how much I hate my life - more than ever before. Typing this I feel like an entitled shit, despite having worked hard for my 'achievements'. Now I am in this cycle of 'want to give up and kill myself', 'somehow get out of it', 'get another rejection with no information on what to improve', 'have another pointless series of fights with family' (I am in the early stages of this at the moment), 'start to lose hope', 'want to give up and kill myself'.  


Basically, it isn't passing - not for very long anyway. I wanted to post here a month ago, but somehow the account creation didn't really work the way I thought and I ended up moving on - but here I am now. I have no idea if this will help. I am actually afraid of reading the same copy/paste responses I hear all the time - assuming that people even want to respond. But I guess there is no harm in trying, hopefully before I hit the linking part of the cycle again. Before one time I fall that bit further I guess? Idk. I feel like I should be apologising for wasting time and space here now.  


So. Thank you for reading this, i guess.

204203,"I'm tiredI'm not sure if I want to die, but I know I want to just stop. Take a minute, step out of my life, and stop to put my head down. I want to get out of myself and rest but I can't really do that, can I? I need to work enough to cover medical bills. I need to stay here for my husband. I need to clean. I need to pay bills. I need to keep going. 

Except I just don't want to anymore. I don't want to be in my city, except I have no choice but to be here. I don't want to be in my country, except I can't leave as we don't have the money or resources to be here. Likewise my husband doesn't want to leave his family.  I want to have a child, but I could never afford to give birth let alone take care of one. 

I just feel like little by little I'm burying everything I want under obligations, expenses and... just an understanding that *I can't do any of it.* It's no one's fault. It's just how it is. It happens to everyone. I'm not trying hard enough. I'm not doing enough.  I'm not enough and it's no one's fault really; It just happens that's how it is. I can't envision the future. I can't imagine myself in a year, let alone five. I'm just trying to get through each day and week to get to the next. 

I realize I'll have these breakdowns where I become aware of everything. I will become aware of what I want and don't/can't achieve, and I'll become sad. I'll get anxious. I'll get upset. Then I'll forget all about it and move on for another few months.

I don't have any mutual friends left due to that fallout too.

My friend was really kind during that time but he is someone who is kinda skittish and quite serious. At some point, I realize he is no longer interested in my stories regarding my abuser because he thinks it as 'indulging' me and face it, they are kinda a downer. It's alright. I don't expect him to know the ramifications and the constant shock and trauma as you find out in retrospect, the insidiousness of the relationship. I respected his boundaries and I always try to be there for him too, I know I am not as close to him as his friends are but he complains to me freely about work (we are not work related) and I can text him whatever I want to through the day and he would always reply me. Then one day he stopped. I don't want to be a bother so I left it as that for a few days. Then I took the initiative to text him and he said he has been tired due to work but that has never stopped him from texting before.

A specific instance of this was when I was telling her about a game I was interested in and I was telling her that it seemed pretty interesting and she wasn’t even listening to me. Midway through my sentence she tells me to do the laundry. Another thing that pissed me off was when the joker movie came out she was telling me that it was evil because she had been listening to news reports about it. I was trying to tell her that it brings good messages about mental illness and good social commentary and she didn’t listen. About a year later I finally saw the movie and big surprise I was right. Currently, she is now into all these conspiracy theories and stuff about the virus and she doesn’t want me to get the coronavirus vaccine because she’s reading all these conspiracy theories about all this random shit. And she has absolutely no idea what she was talking about. Like when I went to the doctor the other day she even asked the doctor about the vaccine and she said she didn’t know to much about it. I’m not saying nurses know everything, but at least they are in a higher position than you and they don’t even know much about it. Another thing about her, is that she can take absolutely no criticism at all. If you give her any she either gets mad at you or calls you disrespectful. If you bring up a problem that she does, she will go for you know how much I do for you’. Sometimes she listens but most of the time she says that. Another thing was, we were picking my friend up yesterday, and she told me to text my dad that we had picked the person up.  She said something that made her sound like she was talking to me if I was 5. which embarrassed me. Today I told her that is embarrassed me and that I didn’t like it, and she said I had no right to be angry at her and that she was my mother. I’m pretty pissed right now I can’t talk to my dad about it because he always sided with my mom. I love my mom she just us a lot of issues and she is choosing not to fix them.",non-suicide

the only thing at the moment that's stopping me from ending everything is that I don't think my mum or my sister would be able to handle it, but that thought gets thinner every day. I really don't want to talk to anyone or go and see a doctor because I don't want my family to see me for how i am at the moment, I'm starting to struggle with keeping up my act for the sake of others and im starting to get fed up of debating whether or not living is worth it.

a few years ago my life changed. after a lot of random occurences i met a girl. this was the first person to ever look at me like im normal and worth as much as anyone else, the first person where i felt valued and appreciated. she gave me humanity from having nothing. it made every single part of my life better, everything became easier, i became happy. she didnt even need to do anything, waking up seeing her there was enough to make my life feel perfect, and to me it was.

i went from spending every single day of my life feeling like shit and not worth anything at all inside while having to keep up a wall of being okay to actually feeling like i had value.

this girl might not have been perfect but she made me feel perfect, she made me feel like a human being, and i would have done anything for her, and i did.

we were together for years, everything was great, we talked about marriage just a week ago, there was nothing wrong. a week ago she went on a short holiday with her friends and yesterday i got a call telling me she was in an accident and didnt make it.

this woman was the only reason ive ever felt like i had any value. i dont know what to do. it was so hard to not just kill myself yesterday, to try and stay in bed and go to sleep. i feel so physically sick i dont know how to go on and i dont know why.

My mind runs rampantly and bewildering thoughts of love and warmly filled hearts break in my sight. I can't do it anymore. The break-up hurts. All break-ups hurt like fuck. Usually I'm more eloquent in delivering a dirge of some sort, but I can't find the words to justify anything beautiful in a break-up. It was her. The entire time, it was her that kept my mind sane, my heart beating, and my fingers typing away stories after stories. She was everything to me. She had the charisma of a puppy awaiting to see its owner, the intelligence of a thousand books, and a smile that even the sun could not brighten more. I miss her. I miss her and I miss every single bit of her. 

She introduced me to the most beautiful of concepts - scientific puns.

She made me understand that a smile is the best thing ever. A smile... her smile. Was my best thing.

She was all I had and all I could ever shoulder. She gave me the deliverance that I so lacked from my atheistic beliefs.

And now. It's empty. Imagine a shell that was filled with a slug. And that slug, after months of using that shell for support, cover, and as a home finds a new one. And that shell loses everything. It fed off the slug giving it meaning. 

Maybe that's a dirt-poor, pissful shit of an analogy, but I feel nothing else compares. What is it about happiness that makes it so fragile and brittle? What is about happiness that shuns away all realities of sadness? Why do I have to go through this?

For anybody reading this, you may not understand how I feel. You may even mock me, tear my words apart with grinning cynicism,  and maybe even resonate with me. It hurts. Imagine a loved one. A mom, dad, grandma, brother, sister, boyfriend, girlfriend, a best friend... just leaving you. No. More than that. Imagine having the closest relationship with them - one that's sprawled with intimacy beyond comparison with any concept or objective understanding. A damn real connection. Imagine that taken away. Taken all fucking away. And not just taken, but taken with a damn vengeance and taken without any justification or remorse. It fucking hurts. It just hurts like hell. I remember mocking all teenage angst-themed books and laughing about how I couldn't possibly sympathize with them. But. Fuck. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

FUCK IT ALL. 

For the last ten fucking years I've been a damn happy kid, not worrying about grades, finance, nor love. I've known ""love"" vicariously and I've learned about it objectively, but I didn't imagine myself falling in love and losing it this badly. I am fucked. It just fucking hurts. I LOVED HER. Before her, everything else was a damn immature experiment. She was real; tangible; holdable; completely soothing to every one of my whimsical fucking moods. And now. Now I can't even find the damn courage to look at my math text book and read to distract myself. 

FUCK. I don't know what to do. I don't know what the fuck to do. 

I know it's a long read and I know you guys can't possibly understand my feeling bereavement, but this... this entire fucking thing is just too much. I've never contemplating suicide, but this is the closest I feel to suicide. Even now I wish I could just get behind a car and let it go. Let everything fucking go.

I still want to kill myself on a daily basis.There's a lot of other reasons, The business I started for myself at the age of 24 Failed recently after a year of being open, so I'm working now at a gas station. I'm living back with my grandmother, and not on my own. I'm on probation, because of something I actually didn't do. And I'm  a hopeless alcoholic, who has been getting black out drunk 5-6 nights a week for about 3 years now.  Me and the old lady were highschool sweethearts, and we dated for about 5 years, before she went off to college and got the taste for living in a dorm. She broke up with me, telling me she had a crush on someone at school. I had not been the perfect boyfriend. I was a little controlling, and I only knew it at the end of the relationship when it was too late to do anything about it.  well that was 4 years ago,  and I cant keep from thinking about it. It's driving me so crazy, that every time I get drunk, (which again, is alot) I play with the .45 that sits on my nightstand, cry, point it at my head and such.  I've done this so often, It seems routine anymore. I think daily, that she's probably very happy, and she hates me, wishes that I'd never entered her life, and that kills me to the point where, I barely have emotions. Nothing seems to impact me anymore. I don't bother to hold conversations with people, because what's the point. Not to mention that no one cares to hear what I have to say anyways.   I have friends that say ""you can come to me with anything"" when really, you know that they cant help out your situation anyways, so really all that you'd be doing is whining to them and probably driving them away. There's pretty much no reason I need to be here anymore..  I'm not enjoying anything. At a bar with my friends, I've noticed that I'll be standing in a group, and no one bothers with me. There always is a conversation going on around me..  I seem to be in the middle of it, and not involved at the same time.   Being almost 25, I've written this off for years as being highschoolish bullshit. but it's all getting worse. I just dont see an end, and it scares the piss out of me.

204334,"""Suicide thoughts"" sub-reddit appears to be dead. Let me try this here.I posted this in suicide thoughts http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideThoughts/comments/cp0yv/this_seems_like_a_nice_quiet_place_to_vent/ because it seemed more to be a more appropriate forum to my needs. I later came to realize that it was a dead forum, and the posts don't even seem to show up. I did find, though, that just writing it out was very helpful, and I have been feeling a bit better.

I was content to just let the post gather cobwebs, it having served the purpose of my venting, but recent events have created questions in my mind. Here is the story.

I recently moved to a new city with my girlfriend. I suffer from some unknown level of depression, which certainly needs to be examined by a professional. When I get depressed, she gets down, she gets distant, I get more depressed. I understand that she needs to take care of herself, but when I am depressed I certainly would like a little more compassion. She told me that if I didn't get help that she would leave me. So, this evening, she broke up with me.

I'm actually pretty calm about it at the moment. A friend gave me half a Xanax. Believe me, though, I do not take this situation lightly.

She told me that there is nothing that can be done. It's over. I believe her, for the fact that she is very black and white in her thinking. Now I am at a point of decision. It will probably put me in a very dark place to continue to live with her throughout the duration of our lease. Especially with the thought that she will move on rather quickly. She's probably having a rebound fuck wherever she is right now.

I feel very disposable. Suicide is running through the back of my mind. I wonder, though. I don't particularly want to die. I just don't want to feel what I feel. I don't want to go to work. I don't want to be awake. It occurred to me, that she is ninety percent of the reason I am where I am. It is a cool city, and I just started a new job with a lot of potential. Overall, I am not that set on staying here. Not with her. Not alone.

Instead of killing myself, how about I bail out? She can keep all of this material crap that she loves so much. I'll walk down the coast with my guitar. I've always wanted to do something like that.......

Jesus. She just came back. Now my mood is completely fucked.

So what'll it be.

A) Kill myself.
B) Give up the hard gained foot hold into a progressive town to bum down to a place where the grass is greener.

I know logically I'm somewhat capable, but I'm helpless to change things around me, and it has eaten away at all of my self confidence and is now chewing me up. I'd rather not wake up tomorrow, or ever. It hurts in that weird way to even think about getting out of bed, and my emotions are a black pit, making it even harder than it was to find any lifeguards (or spelunkers) around to help me out because I can't be even moderately friendly. I am running out of options. ",suicide
204341,"I don't expect replies since it's a novel, I just needed to get this off my chest in full.My fight started when I was in high school. Back then it was only mild depression due to bullies and not having any friends to learn how to be socially accepted. My grades plummeted and even though I wanted t go to university and have a future, my lack of friends and the fact I was now practically a shut in meant that I didn't know how to apply and so I went straight into meaningless jobs instead.

The depression grew to severe and my home life wasn't wonderful. My brother and sister moved away and didn't stay in contact so I was living at home with my alcoholic father and my mother whom even though I loved her very much, she would become a doormat for my father to walk on. I was diagnosed with depression when a cousin of mine noticed the symptoms and forced me to see a doctor. However, the doctors terrified me so I didn't keep up appointments plus I would get into relationships fast resulting in misplaced confidence and spiraling on and off anti-depressants. I just couldn't accept that I was sick and I never saw the same doctor so I was never really given enough information, I was just given drugs.

Then in 2010 I got into an emotionally abusive relationship for two years which stripped what was left of my self-esteem and made me pathetic. After my mother removed me from his flat and he stopped calling at house, all future relationships were doomed to fail. I became needy, unable to trust and constantly thinking they were going to leave me at any moment.

After trying to pick myself up, I was in a small group of friends which built my confidence a little until I was booted out by a couple due to a horrible event. The lady spread lies and hate on every social media outlet she had and the guy stalked my blogs and mocked my mental issues.

Fast forward to now, the couple still pop up but I have real friends and a chance at a wonderful relationship. Fighting these illnesses is too tiring though. I went to a cbt course, changed my doctors surgery and stayed with the same gp to enable them to get to know me, I also underwent 14 sessions of therapy provided by a charity. The cbt did nothing for me but the therapy explained a lot. It allowed me to understand why I turned out this way but it wasn't enough to start healing. Now I don't know what to do.

I don't know where to turn to next. I was also referred to the mental health team but all they did was put my name on a list for a mindfulness course. I'm just scared.

I need to be doing something but I can't afford therapy and I already used the free sessions. It feels like the only way I could get help would be if I hurt myself but thats in the past. I found a way to stop it and I dont want to go back.

I have attempted suicide once while in the abusive relationship but I obviously didn't take enough paracetamol because I woke up with the worst pain I have ever experienced and threw it up.

I have felt suicidal many times but I never go ahead with it because I am either too scared or I feel guilty for anyone I leave behind. My only family left (My mother) died in 2013 and it almost bankrupted the family. I couldn't do that to them. However it's been so long now that I don't care anymore and I am afraid that was what was keeping me here.

The man I am with is the person I wish to be with for the rest of my life. I want to get well but I don't know how. I even applied for University and got two offers but thats 7 months away. Even then I and would still be stuck here in this house. I can't afford to move with a dog so I am stuck here. I can't do anything. No one can help me anymore. I am just a burden.

I am not wanted at ""home"" with these strangers, I am not wanted at my current work and I don't want myself These three places make me feel less than nothing every day and night, but my boyfriend is trying so hard to make me look at the positives. He is the best thing to happen to me but the more he tries, the more I feel guilty. I dont deserve him because if I did, I would find his love enough and I wouldn't want to die so badly.

I'm so sick and I have tried for so long to get help. I'm just so tired and I want to let go. Every night I wish for death, I pay no attention when crossing the road alone and I contemplating trying pills again even though I failed the first time.

204344,"No reason to go onThere’s no reason to be alive anymore. Everything in my life was getting better until 3 months ago when everything fell apart. It started with my girlfriend of 2 years abandoning me, literally. She always told me how much she loved me and that she wanted to be together forever and get married and all this stuff. She left and starting dating someone I used to call my best friend. I’ve been doing worse and worse in school, I even started drinking and doing drugs to try and make it better. It didn’t work. A year ago I was happy and was always there for people and tried to be the best guy I could be. But ever since it all came crashing down I’ve changed and my remaining friends left too. My family wants nothing to do with me and despite all my attempts of making it better, it made it worse. I already tried committing suicide by jumping off a building, I only got banged up really bad. But I never told the real reason why I got hurt. I’ve been with 2 girls since, both left because I wasn’t happy enough. I think about everything I leave behind and what my purpose is. But all I do is video-games all day everyday. At this point, if I just killed myself nothing would change for anyone else. They’d probably just shrug it off and say they expected it.

204361,"Almost ended it all yesterdayYesterday I came so close to ending my life, I drove over to the Golden Gate Bridge to see if I could finally end it all. Though on the weekends it’s too busy and by the time I got there, there was no parking so I gave up and went back home after searching for an hour. I originally went to the bridge at the beginning of the year (on a weekday) thinking about ending it since my life has completely fallen apart in the past year (long story). But once I got there I had gotten scared at the last minute and hesitated. A bridge patrol officer found me on the bridge before I could decide if I would jump or not and I got taken to a hospital. I’ve spent the past few months in therapy which helped me somewhat with some of the things that happened to me.

My family on the other hand wasn’t very understanding or supportive and made fun of me after I was hospitalized. My mom has always been abusive, mainly verbal/mental (and used to physically abuse me when I was a kid) and still continued to insult me for it after. She stopped for a little bit after I got home but then as soon as they thought I was “normal” again she goes right back to her usual self. I want to leave this town, I’m so unhappy here only I don’t make enough from my retail job to be able to move out. I have a degree (animation) and owe 100k in student loans but while I’ve had a bunch of interviews still haven’t landed a job yet. 

Posdibly might be landing a better one soon but am still waiting to hear back from a few places. The worst part is I feel burnt out on my major and am somewhat regretting it (but I owe so much). I wasn’t 100% certain what I wanted to do after high school but I had been pressured by my parents to attend a media arts school since I’ve always been interested in that area. Though now I’m wishing I had gone into something else since the field is so competitive and I’m not feeling as passionate about it anymore unfortunately. The loans start next month and I’m completely screwed. Some of my friends found jobs within a month of two of graduating and I feel awful that I still haven’t landed anything else. I have so many regrets from the past few years and I wish I could change everything. 

The therapist I was seeing I only had four sessions with before she left the company and wasn’t super helpful. I don’t feel she really knew how to help me or specialized in the areas I needed help with (she was assigned at random by Kaiser). Otherwise I’ve been mainly in support groups, which helped at first but isn’t doing much for me now. 

I’m honestly just so tired of everything, my life is ruined and I don’t want to live anymore. I was so disappointed yesterday that I couldn’t end it. Though I’m feeling a little better today. I would just go back during the weekday and do it but I’m supposed to leave with my family for a vacation next weekend and I don’t want to ruin their trip with my death before then.

204371,"What else can I do to talk with my coworkerSo quick brief. I tried to kill myself in 2017, I was admitted to a hospital and found out I was bipolar.

Fast forward to now, I do everything I can to help people with depression and mental illnesses get help.

I'm in leadership at my work and I'm worried about the other guy on my team. A position above us opened up and we both applied, we've both talked about it and how were fine with anyone getting it.

Around this time a girl broke up with my coworker and we were talking outside and he mentioned feeling numb to everything and no emotions to anything. He's been more aggrevated at work, he's been shouldering me out of my normal responsibilities, gets mad when he can't figure something out, and has just seemed.. off.

We talked today for about 45 minutes so he knows the change has me stressed and I feel like I'm useless when he's here as of recently and he thinks it's easier when only one of us is there. We've both interviewed for the position already, 3 weeks ago or so, and since then it's just been different. Anyway during our talk I let him know how I feel and he was not really as responsive as he normally is when we have talks to try and better our work relationship and we both know where we stand.

I brought up the ""numb to everything"" and said that being someone whose attempted suicide and talked with others suicidal I was worked about him. He responded with ""oh I wouldn't try that, I'd just fail at that too and then be mad about that."" I'm trying to be really supportive, I'm trying to setup a trip outside of work where he and I can go fishing for a weekend, texting him about personal stuff off the clock and becoming friends if I can. He's been saying he needs more friends, be smart with his life, and etc. But he just kept talking about being numb, a failure, tired of working where we work at because ""it's all bullshit"" etc.

I'm confused at what to do, I've told with another supervisor who knows him personally too and he said he just gets this way but I rather not have him feeling like this.

Am I wrong for thinking he's suicidal and if not what else can I do to support him that isn't going to cause even more stress on me? I've got a good support base and I'm on medication now so I'm not worried about my mental health but I'm really worried for him, I'm afraid if he doesn't get this position it might set him over the edge.

Please excuse the many typos and grammatical errors - i am physucally disabled and typin on a keyboard is difficult, and autocorrect can be even more difficukt. I also don't know the etiquette so I apologise if this isn't proper.  


I need to end my life. My relationship has ended. I'm not a needy person who can't be single- very much the opposite. I've single most of my 40 years. But I became disabled suddenly 13 years ago. My permanent injuries are still reuiring surgery today, and I don't have pain relief since 'opiates are the devil'. My body was literally crushed in my car and they should have amputtated but deciced ro 'save' my legs, which were literally 'pulverized' as the doctors and techs put it. I have spinal damage too, and now suffer from extreme RA and OA in addition to the injuries. I'm filled with all sorts of mesh and metal. My legs and hand are contoreted and the RA and OA has gotten severe quickly and i'm homebound, pretty much bedbound now. I lived with my partner. He helped me bathe, he was the only reason i ever got to go anyehere (concerts or short trips) since i cannot do it on my own physically or financially. He even had to buy my recent £6000. wheelchair, and when it goes out in a year or two, i won't have one.   


he still worked full time and i look after myself, i'm not totally helpless. But i need help bathing since the bathroom in his house isn't accessible at all. We had just got it approved to be done by the council free of charge, then had a majpr argument and he wants me out of his life forever. In the beginning he still wanted me to saty, he suggested it, and stillw ante dto attend my dr appointments with me. Then overnight on Sunday, he chhanged and couldn't stand the sight of me. He made me call the council and tell them to stop procedure on the bathroom, he wants me out asap. As i have no income all i will get is a shitty council flat in a rough area, i wont be able to afford a phone, or any luxuries, and wont be able to leave the property since i have no family and only a casual friend.   


I could give more detail, but basically i cannot accept a totally isolated life (the chariritie only visit pensioners), without even cable/netflix or internet, and not being able to go do all the things i'd planned to do with him. I was just starting to use my very small monthly PIP to buy craft supplies and start doing those since it was something i could do from home. He's already stopped helping me bathe and said to use wet wipes, he also wont prepare food anymore so i live on snack bars. I can't and won't accept a fate like this. He's taken me out of his will (the house was going to be mine) and he was going to give me a funeral and headstone when i die. Now when i die they'll find me dead in my council flat after i dont pay the bills, and i wont have a headston. Which kills me as my mother didn't have a burial or headstone either.  


I honeslty don't have anything to live for. I need to find the surest way to kill mysef that is the most pain free. I have aurvived a violent rape and being nearly kileld by a drunk driver, i just know that if i wheel off a bridge i'll survive but be more crippled and in more pain. Obv the best way would be a lethal dose of heroin, however as i've never purchased drugs in my life, and don't know anyone who uses, no one is going to sell to me...and i don't know how to mainline. Its so unfair that in severe cases like mine when the person has no future and only pain, assisited suicide isn't legal.   


So, I need to know either a- how do i go about seeming street smart so i can attempt to score heroin, or b- what is a surefire way that will definitley kill me. I really need help guys, and this isn't just cause I'm heartbroken over a breakup. I've wished everyday for oer 10 yrs i'd died when the drunk driver hit me, as i hate being fat, in pain and homebound. But i don't deserve to suffer even more greatly. Help me out?",suicide

204376,"Depression for 5 years... It's taken a sudden turn for the worst...I was just on here really looking for some sort of support or listening to others and how they cope. I don't have a bad life really but I can't escape these thoughts.
I was first diagnosed with depression when I was 13 though no one took it seriously. I had bulimia, anorexia and I didn't really have any friends. I was bullied a lot because I was the sort of girl that asked the teacher for extra homework. The best advice I received was simply ""You just need to cheer up!"" I didn't have anyone to talk to about it as my parents didn't understand the depth of it nor how to help my situation. 
Fast forward to the age of 14; my parents find out that I am bulimic and anorexic and then the self harming starts. I hid it well for months as I was going through my ""emo phase"" and wore bracelets almost all the way up to my elbow so no one noticed it. The only reason anyone found out is because I forgot my school jumper one day and my teacher made me remove all of the bracelets. My parents were contacted and I got one of the worst lectures of my life. My little sister didn't completely understand but it was obvious that she was scared for me.
Age 15. I had started smoking at this point and had been assaulted and beaten by my ex boyfriend multiple times. I didn't want to get out of bed in the mornings and most nights I cried myself to sleep and hoped that I wouldn't wake up again. One morning my parents and I have a huge argument as they try to raid my bag for cigarettes (there weren't any in there but I was an emotional ass child) it ends up with me and my mum in tears and my 8 year old sister screaming that she hated her life. That was what really pushed me over the edge... I had the bottle of paracetamol in my bedroom as I had abdominal pains. I don't know what came over me but I took as many as I could before going to school... My friend found out and reported it and I was rushed to hospital. I had to stay in and have my system pumped and my liver monitored as I'd killed almost half of it. I recovered well but it didn't change the way I felt about life and how much I wanted to just end it all but I didn't try again for the sake of my sister.
age 16: nothing much really happens here, a few relationships that go to sh*t and the self harming increases and I start suffering PTSD about my ex.
age 17: I'm dating a nice guy, I'm singing in a band, I passed my GCSE's and was now in sixth form, what could possibly go wrong?
I fall pregnant with my boyfriend's child. 
I didn't know what to do, we were so scared and panicked about if we could afford a baby and if we could give him/her a good life. We assume we cant and book to get rid of our baby... The day after I find out I'm pregnant I get kicked out of my band. I cried for days. We go to the clinic to talk about the procedure and on the way home we talk about everything and decide we cant go through with it. This is our child after all! I tell my parents... they kick me out of their house so I move in with my boyfriend and his family. It all went well until the rumors started and he finds out that something happened with me and another guy before I fell pregnant. We argue and my mum and dad take me back home but I stay with my boyfriend for the sake of our baby. I didn't have an easy pregnancy, I fell down the stairs, had a kidney infection, ended up with my knee in my stomach, get pushed into walls at school and more but I never damaged my baby. I ended up with internal bruising and was put on bed rest for a few months as the infection was bad. I start getting suicidal again and I don't know who to talk to. I don't want to tell my parents or boyfriend as I don't want them to worry but I don't want to keep it to myself. I almost overdosed again and almost jumped in front of a car, the only thing that stopped me was my baby.
About to turn 18:
I turn 18 in just over 2 weeks. Me and my boyfriend have a lovely house, I have a good relationship with my family. I got engaged and I have a beautiful daughter to love. But my depression is getting worse. Almost everyday I think about ending it and the only reason I don't is because of my little girl., she's the little ray of sunshine that keeps me going, but I now have anxiety, mild anorexia, paranoia (I hear slamming on the door when my partner isn't home and when I'm out I swear that I'm being followed), night terrors and severe depression. I'm now under different organisations to try and help me but it hasn't done anything yet. It's so scary. I got told that it may just be postnatal depression but my daughter is 3 months old now and the feeling hasn't changed at all. I'm terrified of doing something that may seem irrational to those of you who are reading this but to me its very rational and real! I love my little family so much but I need help getting over this. I have my method of ending it planned out in my head in detail and everyday has become a struggle. I don't completely want to die but at the same time I cant help but think that my family, friends and daughter would be better off if I was...

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Being a doormat for everyone to step on, and living like I should hide stuff to not hurt people, in the process of bottling up everything negative because people tell me that “Don’t say anything that will hurt others.”, I ended up just agreeing to everything in life.

And my whole personality is a mess. It’s like a burst of emotions waiting to be released for everyone to see.

BUT THE ONLY DAMM THING THAT WILL HAPPEN IS, “Control yourself.”

I’ve been controlling myself for my whole life, and whenever I DID have an outburst, I will only get reactions of “Learn to watch yourself.”

Nobody understands. NOBODY UNDERSTANDS AT ALL.

I’ve been living like I’m a bottle, and it’s overflowing past the limit. I have emotions too, I just can’t let all of my thoughts out because “I might hurt someone.”

And when I tell people about this, they would say, “It’s ok to let everything out. It’s not good for the heart.”

If I let everything out, people get hurt
If I let everything in, I get hurt

No matter what, someone gets hurt in the end.

204384,"Just wanted to sayI'm 14. The perfect girl.
That's what I was. 

One day, I moved. To another country, another continent.
I was happy. I never thought I could one day be so depressed. Life was good to me as a 10 year old girl.

The school started.
My Innocence finally died completely. I was submitted to almost every single form of torture.

Everyday I was remembered that no one loved me. My parents expectations of me were surreal. I had no friends and became a prisoner of my own feelings and a slave to those people in school that told me I wasn't going to make more friends other than them, because I was a terrible person.

Ugly.
Immature.
Innocent.
Every single offense existent. I was all of that.

I changed schools. Again. I was alone. Again.

Never found friends.
Kept getting remembered that I don't deserve love.
I never did.

Sometimes someone decided to try to be my friend. I always made them go away. Because I am who I am.
I hurted people that I cared about. 

One day a guy decided to try too. He never stopped loving me. But I don't deserve him. And he should notice this soon too. I can't make him go away, even though I know I'm hurting him too.
He has depression. And I am useless to him. He have to find someone else. I care so much for him and want him to be happy, without me.

I don't even know why I'm writing this. All of this must be a mess right now. I'm not thinking, just writing, I need to say something before I go crazy.

I'm not going to kill myself, I just can't. But I really really wanted to be dead. To stop existing. It's so tiring and feeling like I can never be happy just... Makes even more sad. 
Maybe one day I'll be better. I don't know. I won't stop believing this.

Currently I've been struggling with dysphoria a lot. I feel like I'm deformed, or like I'm constantly forced to dress up like a girl. Its like I have an open wound between my legs. 

Seriously, it's super hard functioning right now. It's often distressing having to masturbate, change, use the toilet, or shower with genitals on my body.

And this is just one of many examples.

204449,"Suicide has been in my thoughts for far too long. Help please.I am 25 year old male from Chicago.
I grew up with a divorced parents since I was 7 years old. I have a younger brother who is 5 years younger than me. My parents had us split up to avoid paying each other money. I grew up with my father so it was just me and dad untill I was 20 when then he got arrested for molesting children in secret (now rots in prison). Was not fully connected with my moms side of the family untill my dad getting arrested. Then lived with my mom for 2 years then drifited around went to iowa for a year came back moved in with my moms sister and moms mom for a year and half then moved on my own for half of a year couldnt handle it moved in with my moms brother for half of a year now on my own again and thats going alot better. Ever since I moved from Iowa till now suicide has slowly been planting its self in my head. I have a HUGE time meeting others and talking with people since I drifted around so much and went from job to job to job majority of my life I mostly stick in my room because of reality of saving money and affording to be on my own. I also grew a big issue with my teeth where majority of my teeth were all half gone from not taking good care of my teeth it became more and more of a issue the more time went pass so for 3 years I started dealing with infections and loosing teeth and infections and living on antibotics (yes I know I put my self in that problem) for 3 years I tried and tried to get help that wouldnt cost me my life in money. After 3 hard years of pain and suffering of my problems we finally found a service called Dental dondational service which as of recently has helpped SO MUCH! This is not why im Suicidal. Ive became suicidal because of depression my teeth was a big factor and still is because Im missing teeth in front I have NO smile now im not a big guy let me tell you im a short 5""4 white guy who health wise like hygeine I take very good care of my self I bathe and eat nicely. As of a year ago I started being very aggresive of my mouth hygene so I clean my mouth. So since Im living on bare ends with jobs and have a hard time with people in real life I sit in my rooms and rot my life away. I feel life its usesless to keep going with this stress. I have struggled for the past 5 years to try to better myself to the point where I was comfortable and like living. I have to deal with stress about my dad I have to deal with stress about my teeth I have to worry about being alone because to female will give me a chance in hell because probly I have no money and I have bad teeth even tho I think as for looks Im not that bad looking. I have to deal with stress that this will cont over and over untill im 30-35-50-60-70 DEAD! I just want someone to talk to people to be with hang out with resulting to social media does not work at all dating sites are HORRIBLE Facebook is filled with selfish people who only post things to get likes. I also dont drink or do drugs or smoke cigerettes so going to bars is pointless for me and costly in Chicago. I really just want a friend someone I can really talk to and enjoy spending time with. I think a nice friendship is nice to have in life. I ligetmitly have NONE. Of course I know people but I dont hang out with them because 95% live far away. other 5% that live in Chicago dont really care to hang out. Im tried of living in the dark and thinking this way I just want out of my room out of this life and Im posting on reddit because it seems most people come on here and read things. ",suicide

204454,"I just want it to end.I've been suicidal for as long as my memory can go. No matter where I look in my life, I just feel pain, suffering, and anguish. My childhood can be summed up as follows: I grew up in a hardcore christian zealot household. They didn't believe in medicating so when I was diagnosed with ADHD, they wrote it off as lazy. I also suffer from dyslexia to a lesser extent but nobody picked up on until after i flunked out of college. I also grew up with gender dysphoria and am stuck half way through my transition poor, in debt, and working minimum wage with gov health insurance that is just as bad as snail mail.

I had to endure things like having my fourth grade teacher ask my parents to bring a cardboard refrigerator box to put me in during class as to not disturb the other students. I owe the department of education money because I couldn't understand the legal agreement on the Pell Grant and some screw up financial aid lady at the college assured me that I wouldn't have to pay it back, even if for some reason I couldn't pass my classes.

The disabilities department at the college had lost my form so I wasn't able to get any assistance from them because I ""didn't turn it in within the deadline"". And to add insult to injury, my health insurance stopped covering the ADHD medication shortly into college thus causing me to struggle until I was academically dismissed for my grades. I wound up jumping from job to job and fighting my insurance to get that medication back, and see someone for my gender dysphoria which I ended up having to myself not covered by the insurance. They refused all services related to my gender dysphoria and I spent 2 years juggling work and fighting for them to cover anything until I had a mental break and went into the E.R. on a 5150 2 years ago.

The doctor put me on a mandatory full medical leave as I was not mentally fit to work. My significant other had contacted my employer to notify them that I was going on FMLA and they ended up firing me for ""no call no show"". I wound up having another mental snap and had to be admitted on a 5150. when I got out, I stayed at my boyfriends dads house till I found a job and we found an apartment. We moved into it, both names on the lease and everything. As soon as the first month went by, I started slipping into another depressive episode, he tried cheering me up, coerced me into birthday sex, and then took my portion of the rent for the next month and threw me out. Every attorney I met with said I had no case even though he broke a legal contract. The only person in my life that has any form of importance lives 14,000 miles away, is on disability, and just been told she can't come back to america anymore if she wants to stay qualified for her disability.

I never asked to be born with ADHD, dyslexia, and gender dysphoria. I never would of accepted the financial aid If I knew failing a course would require me to pay it back. I never chose this. I don't see this as a life, I see it as a cruel fucked torture that people say will get better. Every time someone has shown me a light at the end of the tunnel, Its ended in me being worse off. I can't live any longer if whats in front of me is just as bad as my past.",suicide
204455,"Feeling pretty good right now. Stark contrast to my usual. Sending you all the positive vibes I possibly can. Broke free from my anxiety a bit today, so I’ve been riding that high.

I’ve made a few friends these past 6 months. They’re all truly wonderful people, I’m beyond lucky to have them in my life.

I’ve got a roof over my head, access to water, food, etc.

I’m leaning back on my bed in a hoodie &amp; sweats that I pulled out of the dryer a while ago, feeling comfortable as hell.

Got some LoFi filling the room totally enhancing this good vibe

My head isn’t clouded with depression or anxiety. Any worry or doubt is whisked away by the soft sound of this music.

For the first night in a very long time, I feel okay. I hope you do too. And if not, please, I invite you to join me in stopping for a bit to enjoy some LoFi with me, [here.](https://youtu.be/li9CFMag7_A)

204461,"Moods are back and forth and making me exhausted.I feel like I can't do it, but I wish I could. And right now I'm not even in a bad place: I'm home with my parents and my older sister and my boyfriend is texting me, but I can feel the depression coming on and I don't know why. Maybe because I have to go back to college on Monday and possibly fail out.

For the past few years I've been dealing with being depressed and anxious and whatever else. I am iron and vitamin D deficient but I have taken them to see if it improved my mood and they didn't, and I kind of wish they were a slower, quieter way out. But I doubt skipping my iron and vitamin D pills will kill me.

I'm the only child in my entire family, extended included, going to college. My mom is a straight A registered nurse with a specialization in oncology and she is my hero and my envy. She's smart and organized and I will never be the success story she's hoping for. My sister dropped out of college forever ago--drugs and general laziness--and I've had a hard time. 

I'm at college #3, going away again. GPA ranges from what it is now, a 1.7, up to a 3.8. I suck at science, but science is what I want. I'm a great writer (not to be arrogant, but I kind of am and I've written several novels) and I know I should be an English major but there's no money or future. So I decided I'd be a vet tech. Animals are cute and medicine is cool.

Huge mistake. It's fucking *hard*. I am not as smart as the other people in this program, mostly pretty blonde girls who are fresh out of high school. I'm 21 and I feel too old to still not have even my associate's degree. I have like 50-something random credits. I am an absolute freak. I don't understand why I can't buckle down. They all go for extra practice and studying and I want to lie in bed after classes (which run from 8-5 three days a week, giving me no time to eat a damn thing). I just don't *care*.

My depressed moods are getting worse and worse. I will rotate between feeling invigorated and smart and high-achieving and feeling like a complete fucking loser. Usually the depression comes on when I hit a wall or something stupid sets me off. A professor made me cry last week and I was so goddamn close to getting in my car and crashing it. She just stared at me while I cried in front of her and didn't say a thing. Didn't care. I emailed her and apologized and she sent me an academic warning.

It's just exhausting me at this point. I spend three or more nights a week crying and Googling reasons why I shouldn't kill myself. I'm under a lot of pressure from my family to succeed and there's intrinsic pressure, too. I don't want to drop out and move on to the next college. My boyfriend will think I'm a loser, my mom will be SO disappointed, and my grandpa will be heartbroken.  

I tried for an easy out and asked my mom what she thought about me just getting an English associate's degree from my local community college and she laughed. Said ""you're not getting some bullshit diploma."" I know she's right; even though I'd be lucky to make $35k as a vet tech it's a degree with a job tied to it. But I'd be SO happy sitting in an office all day typing stuff or calling people. Really. Not that being a vet tech would be miserable but this program is crushing me.

I don't know... It's not just the depression that hurts, but the crashing from feeling optimistic to feeling like absolute shit. I was hoping to get engaged this year but I can't if I'm not at least en route to graduating school. This place destroyed my GPA so I don't know what would happen. I want to get the fuck out of college and not have to feel like every day is a struggle.",suicide

204470,"How do I keep going like this.I'm in a bad place at the moment, actually, bad would be an understatement. I started cutting myself again last night after a particularly painful dream. The dream started with reliving the last time I saw...her... reliving her hands on me... her marking me... the feeling of being violated.  The dream then shifted into a mix of the hell that is ...her... and the hell that is my mother. My mother is a very religious woman, and her denying to accept me, at all, just because I happen to like women and men, is a common thing that crops up in my dreams. Where was I? Oh yeah, I was being violated, then it suddenly shifts to my mother and I in my kitchen, she starts berating me and belittling me calling me a whore, a faggot, a sodomite. Every name in the book. I just stood there and took it, I soaked in her words. I then shifted back to... her... again, but this time I was in my guest bed restrained. I shifted back to my mother, she was still going at it, but I started to cry and beg her to stop, she called me pathetic and hit me. I shifted again and I was in my bathroom looking at myself in the mirror and assessing the damage, the bruises she left on my breasts and neck. I saw the knife my dad had given me the day prior on counter, and I started cutting. I sliced violently anywhere there was remains of where she touched me. That's when I woke up. It was 3 a.m. and I saw the knife on my bedside table and reversed 7 months of restraint. My mother and I had an argument the other day where the topic of my bisexuality came up, where she used a few of the colorful words that she used in my dream to describe how she felt. But she hasn't hit me in a long while so I don't know where that came from. I haven't seen ...her... since the start of quarantine and recently I've been worrying about having to see her again when school starts back normally, I'm scared of what she's going to do to me, I blocked her on all social media, but there's no way to protect myself when I see her in person. And I know that I have it coming because of what I did, blocking her and all. I'm screwed. So I've been toying with the thought of death again. Killing myself, so that I dont have to see her ever again, so she won't haunt my dreams anymore. Or to scar myself so severely that I'll be so undesirable to her that she'll leave me alone. I've tried telling people. But no one believes me. No one listens to me. Since she's a pretty girl no one believes me. I want this to end so bad. I feel like she is controlling my every move. I want to control my own life again, but I can't. If I can't figure out another solution I'm going to kill myself before I have to see her again.

He's been in love with this girl for about 7 years, and he recently got engaged to her. A few days ago however she died in a car crash because of a drunk driver. He was later told after she died that her unborn child, that he didn't know about, had also died in the crash. 

I talked to him over voice chat and he's emotional of course. Better than I expected but I'm still terrified for him, someone doesn't just go through this and not consider suicide. He's told me in the past before all of this that he's purchased a firearm for the explicate reason of having a painless and easy way out should he need it. When I was talking to him over voice chat he went between stories of people who he ""couldn't save"" at the ER he works at and stories of this girl. I tried to comfort him and give as much support as possible, but I have no idea if its enough. He told me that he's on some medication now as well and gets a month off work which is good. But I wish I could just do something more, because I doubt words we be enough.  


He claims he's been through worse (abusive father) but still. This isn't good for certain, I had him call someone to stay with him IRL but I'm still worried. I want, no, need to be able to help. I can't see something happen to him, and I'm not sure what to do.

My few friends have given up on me, their significant other always number one priority. I'm stuck in a loop of self improvement-no rewards in trying to get my life sorted out. I feel like I have everything I need except for a significant other to share my life with and of course I'm stigmatized for it, I'm not entitled to someone's love no matter how hard I work on myself and keep being praised to be this fantastic gorgeous, smart and funny person. I'm in this loop of being told to stay confident and it will happen when you expect it less. Bullshit, not for someone WHO NEVER HAD A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP in his life. I get to be a spectator while I break my back getting what others managed to do without thinking about it.

Im tired of living, the depression never left over those 10 years, medication helped temporary but didn't remove my need for companionship at the back of my head. I was born and raised so others could feel better about themselves. I have to keep working and praying while others watch me with their smug faces believing they also had to struggle to get there.

Im sorry if this sound stubborn but i know for a fact ill never be happy alone. My doctor even asked me if i looked into finding a partner... I couldn't hold my laugh, i've been trying just that for years. Im at a point where people who used to tell me to find happiness elsewhere now telling me to write what I want from a woman in personality traits on a piece of paper, hide it and pray you'll meet that person.

204483,"I can never be totally honest about how suicidal I amLong-term and recurrrent depression and all the accompaniments. With meds and therapy I've still ended up having severe episodes every few months/year. Each episode gets a bit worse. Ironically I am stopped from trying to kill myself now by the fears - fear of getting into trouble/getting caught/upsetting my family and getting into trouble, fear of just maiming myself, fear of the nothingness/unknown I expect to be on the other side. All the time the urge to hurt myself or just push all the way through is so strong. I keep deadening myself so that I can carry on acting normal and working etc but ultimately I see no point. 

I think I'm scared of the point in the sequence of actions where I would stop being in control of the process - at some point I would lose control. All the methods I tend towards favour retaining some control but I won't be able to keep that until the end, which scares me. I was talking to a friend today about these urges and he said that this means I'm not unsafe/dangerous to myself, because I'm still talking about it, as opposed to not talking about it and just doing it. That felt fucking invalidating. Not that I want to be ""classified"" as a danger to myself, but I really struggle to ask for help, and it's an irrational kind of confirmation that I don't need to be asking for more help right now - I'm obviously doing ok. 

I've seen my therapist an extra time, and I can't afford to see her for any more extra sessions now.

Anyway, I'm a very good student, with straight As in my AP and honors classes. Honestly, if I wasn't a good student I don't know what I would have. My social life is somewhat lacking, though greatly improved in recent months. I haven't been diagnosed or anything, but I'm rather sure I have social anxiety.

The next day, we spent a few hours at the mall together and then he slept over. Later in the week, he read but ignored all my messages but then we went to the theater to watch a movie together. Today, we were playing Call of Duty together when he had to go eat. I decided to just wait rather than play a game without him, so I waited for 15 only for him to leave the party without a word, presumably to join a different party with a different friend and play CoD alone, like he did last night. I asked him why he left but he ignored my text. When I asked him why he was ignoring me he ignored that too. Honestly I don't know why I put up with his shit but for some reason I do because I just really like him. But today, I swear to God, I could punch him in the face and call him a cunt. But somehow tomorrow morning, he'll find a way to play it off like nothing happened and like I wasn't really hurt by what he did. And somehow my stupid fucking brain will pretend I wasn't hurt either. I can't tell if he's just messing with me without realizing how hurtful it is, or if he's just a massive dick.

I don't get invited anywhere, it's always me initiating shit. And my best friend whole I've known basically my whole life and I have somewhat drifted apart.

Now school. School is just so stressful I can't handle it. I'm doing really well but there's just so much work involved. Hours of homework, which leads me to play hours of video games to escape, which leaves me with just enough time to sleep to gain the energy I need to spend hours in school the next day. Essay here, vocabulary there, test, test, test, project, etc. It's awful.

I've been depressed for years, to begin with nothing all too bad, I never told anyone though, it was always bottled up. Last December, school found out.

and i don't know how to carry on, like that. i went to the counsellor and they told me i had a perfect life. my family get so angry and frustrated that i have nothing to say, because i don't. i have nothing im hiding, no big secrets, no reason to be miserable. my friends found out their friend wants to die. it's ruined them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv0FFxiWOUY (Just incase anyone wants to hear the song I have on at the moment, for mood setting)

My life has been fucked since the day I was born. Born to a broken family, an abusive mother, in extreme poverty, barely knowing my father until later years. 

When I was 9 my mother tried to kill herself, I spent months raised by my grandmother, visiting my mom in the psyche ward.

when I was 11, I got into drugs, (Railing dexidrine, ridalin, morphine, smoking pot, cigs, beer). 

at 12, I hung myself with an industrial sized chain, in my closet of my bedroom. I woke up on the floor, with both ends undone.

by 16 I had been on and off the streets homeless many times, was addicted to cocaine, many pills. I've spent entire winters in alleyways, in -30C weather (winters here get very cold). More of my teenage years was spent homeless, than not.

by 18, I had already OD'd three times... to the point of being KO. even having my heart and breathing stop at one point.

18, one daughter was born, I started my road to sobriety around this time too.

19, another daughter born, different mother.

Most of their lives I was not around, sadly, not by choice. Elder kid's mother used her as a weapon against me for leaving her, for years. Nowadays, She lives with my mother and I share joint custody with my mother (I gave her to my mother after my daughter came into my care due to bad decisions by the mother. but, I wasnt in the right spot financially to suddenly take on that role, so my mom offered to help.)

When I was 21, my mother wrote me a letter to apologize for being abusive and a bad mom, rather than a birthday card that year, and has been a good mom, and a great grandmother / caretaker for my kiddo. My daughter is in a good place, and I know that I won't have to worry about her when I'm gone. 

My other daughter also was weaponized by the mother, and I have seen her no more than a week of her life. She lives a 6 hour drive away, and I have no car, so I couldn't even if I wanted.

I'm 28 nowadays. Sober from chemical drugs nearly a decade. I'm in my last semester, of a two year college program. I'm financially ABSOLUTELY FUCKED, but overall, I'm further ahead in my life than I ever have been before. 

...But it's not enough. I've been wanting to die since I was 12. I've tried a few more times, but all of them since that first time, were only half hearted, because I'm scared. Having OD'd to the brink of death as a junkie, and having hung myself in the past, I remember how it feels to slip away, I remember how it feels to basically die...and it's not (in my opinion) a very 'nice' feeling.

I'm a coward, you see. I'll run from 99% of fights. I'll hide in the bathroom to eat my lunch because I'm too socially anxious to sit with people, unless I know them. Last night, my recently graduated firefighter student roommates, threw a GIANT house party, FILLED with gorgeous women (seriously, it was like a movie) and I spent the entire night in my bedroom, because I'm too shy and cowardly to go socialize and try to meet anyone.

I'm also so cowardly, that I want to die SO FUCKING BADLY, for 16 FUCKING YEARS NOW, and the only thing keeping me alive at this point, isn't my daughters, isn't my chance after college at a good life (because I stopped caring about obtaining that many moons ago), but literally just because I'm too cowardly to hang myself or something again.

If I had a gun, it might be easier. Pull the trigger, no thought, bam, done. I could get super drunk to make it easier to do...But I can't afford a gun. 

It's not just my past that haunts me. I can shove it into the back of my mind... But my present day is fucked. I have tattoos on my hands that I cant afford to cover up, that have cost me so many jobs...People look at me strangely...etc. They are the sigils of Satan (Google images ""Satans Sigil"" there is two different ones. One like a triangle shape with a V, one shaped kinda like a martini glass). I used to recognize as a theistic satanist. Nowadays, atheist. My teeth are not rotten thankfully, given my history, but they are very badly taken care of over the years and it shows, not to mention I desperately need braces. The point in mentioning these details, is that even though I wear nice clothes (I have made sure during pockets of financial stability, to buy new and nice clothes etc, so nobody outwardly would know just how bad life is.) and I do my hair good and whatever, but I still LOOK 'bad' enough I guess, that nobody ever approaches. I can't remember the last time a woman checked me out walking down the street. I cant remember the last time my feeble attempts at getting a phone number, got me anything other than a disgusted look and a ""Uh. No."" All my past relationships, have been through other people. Friends of friends. But that well has run dry. The only female attention I get, weirdly, is from numerous women who are either attached and want to cheat on their partner, or in open relationships and want me as a side piece. I guess maybe I'm good enough to fuck on occaision, but just a dildo with legs. 

That said, my suicide desires, are not solely based around a lack of romance. 

I'm very alone. I do have a few friends who try to be there as much as anyone could ask of someone. People who come hang out occaisionally...But I feel alone. I have felt this way for 16 years. It doesnt matter how happy I should be...I've been engaged to a GORGEOUS woman (seriously...like 9/10. I dont know how I did it.) and I fucked that relationship up; but even when we were at our happiest, I still secretly wanted to die, almost every day. I've never gone more than a week without longing for it.

I want to die, so, fucking, badly...and I can feel like its getting closer and closer to finally having the strength...

I don't know why I posted this, I just didn't know where else I could express my mind anonymously with people who actually fucking get it, or won't judge.

204504,"I need help, pleaseLast month has been the hardest yet. 
I was finally moving along with the pain of having my heart break since January, but then I started having a lot of family issues.
My ex broke up with me and I have to move back in with my parents. They do have a pretty toxic relationship and argue a lot, but things got worse when part of my family start acussing us of trying the still the heritage left by my grandfather (which, btw, is completely bs). My once united family is now completely shattered and I feel like my support system is broken as well.
I'm tired of still suffering for my ex, I'm trying of crying every night to sleep, I'm trying of how much of my day is just working. I'm also completely scared of the future, 'cause I have no idea what I want to be or where I want to be. I lost all my future plans this year and feel so insecure about me.
I'm not a child, I'm 26 and feel like my life is stuck.
Im going to therapy and that had help a lot, but nights like this one the only thing I can think about is fading away from this world.
What scares me the most is hurting myself physically and what my friends/family would think of me if I finally got the courage to do it. Will it hurt them? Will they feel guilty? I don't want that emotions for them.",suicide
204505,"My life sucksSince I was a child I was humiliated, emotionaly and psychologicaly abused and tormented.
My life since early days felt like prison combined with boot camp.
In schools I had 'buddies' in school but not real friends, was bullied also, never had a girlfriend, I didn't even speak to girls.
When I was 20 I tried to commit suicide but it was not successfull as the dosage was too low.
I was mugged and robbed about 10 times in my life, which only raised my anxiety and me being untrustfull in people.
Now I have crippling depression and anxiety, I cannot speak normaly with other people and make friends, the last time I went out to someone and speak with someone as a 'buddy' was 7 years ago.
Currently I'm 30 and still never had a girlfriend, and my longing for romantic relationship is killing me.
I'm living with my strict parents that control every aspect of my life, they have to know everything and about everything, when I was younger they did not allow me to go anywhere and usualy I had to be at home by 7 or 8pm.
That is why i'm not even trying to speak to women, because I know I would have to find a way around my parents or lie to them.
I have a job, so potentialy I could move out, renting something as I don't have money for a house, but in some way I still want to be with them even though i'm 30 now and basicaly i'm forfeiting my life.",suicide
204508,"Struggling to hold it togetherI'm 24 (m) and I literally feel like a complete failure at life. I have got a degree but am currently unemployed and living off my parents. I have been suffering from depression on and off for 6 years now. I feel like a complete joke. I have never had a girlfriend and I am struggling to see the point of anything. I also feel like a very weak person. Just sick of everything.

A lot of my friends seem to be making progress in life, but I am still stuck doing nothing. I have made numerous changes in my life multiple times, but I always end up miserable no matter what. I got a job, but I was even more depressed that I was when unemployed. Moved to a different country, still miserable. I have zero motivation and absolutely hate working with/for other people.

I generally have a pessimistic view of humanity and despise about 50% of people. I can't help this. Every time I try to be more optimistic, millions of things prove otherwise. Why kid myself. 

I abuse alcohol/drugs to the point of blacking out 1-2 times a week. I don't really care about stopping this as I don't really see the point. All that happens is I end up getting bored/depressed when sober. At least when I am hammered, I can forget about how much of a failure I am for a few hours.

I am also pretty sure I am suffering with a serious mental illness. A lot of people have said to me that they think I am mentally unwell and need help. My behavior is completely erratic most of the time (especially when drunk).

I have found myself idealizing suicide recently more often. I just think about how easy it would be to make all my problems disappear. I am pretty sure I am doomed to be miserable anyways so what is the point in going on.

The only reason I have not followed through is because of my family. They are very good people and they care about me a lot.

204510,"I’m just tired of tryingFirst time posting anything on reddit, wish it had been under better circumstances than this but oh well.

Anyways my backstory is that I am a 19 year old male that has suffered from bad social anxiety for the vast majority of my life. All throughout high school I was scared to go to parties where there would be more than a few people because I didn’t want my social anxiety/awkwardness to get in the way and make me seem like even more of an idiotic loser than I already make myself out to be. Somehow I managed to get through high school and 2 weeks after graduating I left for the Army, and for once I actually kinda truly enjoyed something in my life. But as life would turn out I got injured during training and was medically discharged last month after serving only 9 months of my 6 year contract. Once I was put on medical hold I was treated like utter shit by just about everyone, and as you can imagine this didn’t go so well for my state of mind and it quite frankly destroyed me mentally. Throughout the agonizing months as a medical holdover awaiting discharge I never went to see anyone about my depression, mainly because I feared what might happen and how it might affect my future civilian life, and the thought of that absolutely terrified me. So now here I am back in the civilian world labeled a “disabled vet” at the age of 19 feeling mentally drained and depressed every single day. I am set to start college this upcoming fall but in all honesty I just don’t know about this life anymore. I’m tired of hearing the same things like “You’re  so young, you shouldn’t be worrying about stuff like that” or “things will get better once you go to school or get a job.” I’m always told to go out and make new friends but every time I try I just end up making a fool of myself. The few friends that I had moved away to college and don’t care too talk to me anymore, and every attempt I’ve made at getting to know a girl has been an absolute failure. I just feel like a weak worthless man who doesn’t have any talent, has never had an actual relationship, and fails at every attempt in advancing in life. Believe me when I say that I would have pulled the trigger long ago, however I fear that my suicide would break my mothers and grandparents heart and I really don’t want my depression to affect their lives as it has affected mine.I don’t really know what I hope to get out of typing this or if anyone really cared enough to read through it all, but I’m honestly just in the stage of staying up every single night debating about whether or not I should stay and fight or just push the off button.

This is going on a lot longer than expected, so I'll just keep going. All throughout Elementary school I was bullied and kept as an outcast and the one nice kid everyone came to with there problems abd of course, with the hope I could finally be one of them the ""Popular"" kids I would just go back to being treated as a outcast. So believe me or not, I've been depressed since 2nd or 3rd grade. So with that, I've grown up to be the asshole who people still come to for help but just leave me in the dust.

I place my head down bc looking up and being apart of society is useless. My mere existence is contrary to society’s development. I have hid my desires of the same sex for too long. I have been told of the fire and brimstone waiting for me on the other side and at this point, i’m done living in agony and anxiety. I’m fed up with being a loser and a lost soul itching for someone to love me. I’m now a shell of skin and blood. I feel like nothing. A smile here and there but nothing more. I’m so empty and sad. I’m scared to die but I feel so trapped in this world. My desire is detestable not only to the one above but the ones around. Once my family knows, I will be next day’s trash on the curb. I am sick and undesirable. I’m disgusted with myself and feel it’s my duty to rid the world of my existence but am too scared to carry it out. I guess i’ll just stick posting here as a public diary of sorts. I’m sorry to myself for being such a sick individual. I’m repulsed by myself and assume the rest of the world is, as well. I can’t hide anymore and I won’t marry a woman in hopes of acceptance. I can’t do it anymore. I don’t want to kill myself but can’t help uttering the opposite every day of my life. Goodbye.

Then, I was thinking. My new semester starts on the 1st of April. Might as well kill myself on that day.


Here some background
I just recently knew as well after dugged up my past.

1. I can classify myself as both mentally weak and physically weak. Just happened to got the genes like that from both of my parents

2. My mom died of suicide when I was 4. She had a crippling depression before and after giving birth to me. Also had diagnosed with something called 'baby blues'

3. My father cheated on my mom while he had me and knew that something is wrong with my mom. To make things more funny, after a year of my mom passed away, we live together in the same house, living in the same room.

Hahaha... at first I thought being cheated by girlfriend with my bestfriend in  my last semester in HS, one month prior to national exam was already bad enough. Recently (September last year), my ex left me because of her ex and my depression.

And now I recently learned this? Can I just be done with myself? Like legit I'm tired too

I keep feeling more and more dejected as the time goes on. With my bestfriends, 'my own family'. Heck even my father can only say 'it will pass', 'there are other people who went worse'.

Yeh, I'll keep this facade of nothing happens to everyone else in my community while I'm counting my days to end.

/I do seek for help, did counseling instesively within my economic capability, but yeah somehow I still don't see the worth for keep moving forward/

204578,"I finally realized that I just let him live in my head rent free while he was probably using me I had the biggest crush on this guy since last January. He went to basics over summer and once back we only got closer as friends and then soon enough, boyfriend and girlfriend. It made me so happy to think that he actually liked me back and that people do think I'm pretty. He broke up with me as a house fire took the lives of his aunt and cousins, and then 3 more deaths followed (I do not know the cause of them). He couldn't balance family, school, sports, military, and a relationship so he broke it off, but we stayed friends.

I had high hopes that maybe once things were able to level out again we could start dating again. Needless to say that hasn't happened. Over the past month I've noticed that our conversations were dry and eventually he just stopped responding to me. I thought I was doing something wrong but some third party views say otherwise. 

We first became friends last school year and then the pandemic hit. He wanted to go out and have fun before leaving for three months. He paid me to take over his schoolwork for April and I agreed. We even hung out at the pond on my parent's property because it was hot outside n all. Our senior year started and we had a class together. I was over the moon.

He started pressing for answers from me on that class and one that I had already taken (Algebra 1). I agreed on the terms that he gave me all the answers to English in the second semester because I'm not good at English. The deal was made and everything was fine. 

For fucks sake he was my first kiss, the first guy I cuddled, the first guy I sent nudes to. And to him I was the first girl he genuinely wanted to sleep with. I know now naive and happy go lucky I sound a the time. It's both a blessing to have and a curse because I always expect and hope for the best from people. I can't dare think about people close to me doing wrong.

I should've listened to my friend's warnings about his past with girls.

The first semester is over and we are now three weeks into the second semester. I logged out of his school account (I only kept it to access his assignments easier and with his consent of course) because I realized that English wasn't so bad.

I just want to ask him if I did something wrong or if he's just moved on, but part of me knows that it is a bad idea. I hope that this is a misunderstanding and that he will eventually text me sometime, but I'll take that hope with salt. I still have my college years ahead of me and much more.

204581,"I spent 3 days in a mental health unit (psych ward), AMAIt wasn't as bad as stories make it out to be. I'll answer any questions you have about my experience while doing my best to retain the confidentiality of my peers. I came out of the experience feeling much better and my peers would likely say the same thing.

Basically, the ward was filled with people who were on the edge of suicide, people who had tried to kill themselves, and people who came for other health problems and ended up there. Many were self medicated on various drugs and alcohol. Most people were down to earth and easy to talk to. Everyone was there to help themselves and everyone had some idea as to when they were ready to go back into the world. Having people near you with similar issues was one of the best parts of the experience.

Days were structured and contained five or so 45 minute groups each day (although they usually didn't last as long). Groups included topics such as emotional boundaries, time management, AA, MICA, and other psychotherapy-related stuff. There was plentiful free time and visiting hours throughout the day. Meals were served at 8 am, 12 pm, and 5 pm with snacks at 8pm and 11:30 pm. TV time was limited to free time and visiting hours (hours were something like 8-8:30, 12-12:45, 5-7, 8:30-10). There was a 20 minute in which patients meeting certain qualifications were allowed to take a walk outside.

Care and treatment consisted of a team of doctors and nurses including psychiatrists, group leaders, discharge planners, and 1 on 1 therapists. Each person was assigned a psychiatrist who would remain with them throughout their time in the unit and a 1-on-1 therapist who changed each day. Each morning all people involved in treatment would have a 1 hr+ meeting to discuss each patient individually. After the meeting each persons' psychiatrist and therapist would meet with them at some point in the day.

I volunteered myself into the program because I was having a bad reaction to my depression medication. I felt like I made a mistake in the beginning, but I adjusted to it as time went on and got used to the environment. It can feel a bit like a prison in that you're told what to do, but as long as you remember why you're there these feelings will dissipate. I had a snoring roommate but I was able to sleep with earplugs the first night, earplugs + a sleeping pill the second night, his using his breathing machine the third. Again, talking to people was one of the best parts of the experience. I'm usually a shy and isolated person, but it's easy to talk to people who have been through the same things I have; they can empathize with what I feel.

Other stuff: We weren't allowed to have cell phones or computers (due to confidentiality). This was okay but it could get boring if there was free time and no groups going on. This may not be the case in all units, but I would bring some books. I spent a lot of my time doing homework.

For me having a girlfriend means quite a lot. It holds a very high value. For me GF is someone whom you can trust on and could literally tell anything that's on your mind and could sometimes even ask for her shoulder to put your face on and feel embraced during the hard times.

And as you call tell by now Yup I'm an Introvert. 

I've been alone for most of my life so I don't actually know how to communicate with strangers or how to flirt or how to get the conversation going.

It feels like in my past has told me: this is a red flag. Avoid it and avoid hurt.

But sometimes those red flags are actually not really bad signs, and it's just me overcompensating my fear by shutting it down early.

It just feels like all the times my parents break my heart, and every time I've forgiven, has just led me to believe that people will always take advantage. That I will always feel like an inconvenience, an annoyance, someone who doesn't deserve to exist or be treated with respect.

I find that whenever someone shows me a small action of respect, I feel indebted to them because I feel like it's something I don't deserve.

And the eveningand morning were the sixth day.Chapter 2So the heavens and the earth were finished, andall the furniture of them.2And on the seventh day God ended his workwhich he had made: and he rested on the seventhday from all his work which he had done.3And he blessed the seventh day, and sancti-fied it:  because in it he had rested from all hiswork which God created and made.4These are the generations of the heaven andthe  earth,  when  they  were  created,  in  the  daythat  the  Lord  God  made  the  heaven  and  theearth:5And every plant of the field before it sprungup  in  the  earth,  and  every  herb  of  the  groundbefore it grew:  for the Lord God had not rainedupon the earth; and there was not a man to tillthe earth.6But a spring rose out of the earth, wateringall the surface of the earth.7And the Lord God formed man of the slimeof  the  earth:   and  breathed  into  his  face  thebreath of life, and man became a living soul.8And the Lord God had planted a paradise ofpleasure from the beginning:  wherein he placedman whom he had formed.9And  the  Lord  God  brought  forth  of  theground all manner of trees,  fair to behold,  andpleasant  to  eat  of:   the  tree  of  life  also  in  themidst of paradise:  and the tree of knowledge ofgood and evil.10And a river went out of the place of plea-sure to water paradise, which from thence is di-vided into four heads.11The name of the one is Phison:  that is itwhich compasseth all the land of Hevilath, wheregold groweth.12And  the  gold  of  that  land  is  very  good:there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.Book of Genesis513And the name of the second river is Gehon:the  same  is  it  that  compasseth  all  the  land  ofEthiopia.14And the name of the third river is Tigris:the same passeth along by the Assyrians.

For in what day soeverthou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.18And the Lord God said:  It is not good forman  to  be  alone:  let  us  make  him  a  help  likeunto himself.19And  the  Lord  God  having  formed  out  ofthe  ground  all  the  beasts  of  the  earth,  and  allthe fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to seewhat he would call them:  for whatsoever Adamcalled any living creature the same is its name.20And  Adam  called  all  the  beasts  by  theirnames, and all the fowls of the air, and all thecattle of the field:  but for Adam there was notfound a helper like himself.21Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep uponAdam: and when he was fast asleep, he took oneof his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.22And the Lord God built the rib which hetook from Adam into a woman: and brought herto Adam.23And Adam said:  This now is bone of mybones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be calledwoman, because she was taken out of man.24Wherefore  a  man  shall  leave  father  andmother,  and  shall  cleave  to  his  wife:  and  theyshall be two in one flesh.25And they were both naked:  to wit, Adamand his wife:  and were not ashamed.Chapter 3Now the serpent was more subtle tha any of thebeasts  of  the  earth  which  the  Lord  God  hadmade.

And  she  answered:  Theserpent deceived me, and I did eat.14And the Lord God said to the serpent:  Be-cause thou hast done this thing, thou art cursedamong all cattle, and beasts of the earth:  uponthy  breast  shalt  thou  go,  and  earth  shalt  thoueat all the days of thy life.15I  will  put  enmities  between  thee  and  thewoman,  and  thy  seed  and  her  seed:   she  shallcursh thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for herheel.16To  the  woman  also  he  said:  I  will  multi-ply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions:  in sorrowshalt thou bring forth children,  and thou shaltbe under thy husband’s power, and he shall havedominion over thee.17And to Adam he said:  Because thou hasthearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eatenof the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thoushouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work:with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all thedays of thy life.18Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth tothee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat breadtill thou return to the earth out of which thouwast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thoushalt return.20And Adam called the name of his wife Eve:because she was the mother of all the living.21And the Lord God made for Adam and hiswife garments of skins, and clothed them.22And he said:  Behold Adam is become asone of us, knowing good and evil:  now thereforelest perhaps he put forth his hand and take alsoof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.23And the Lord God sent him out of the par-adise of pleasure, to till the earth from which hewas taken.24And he cast out Adam:  and placed beforethe paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flam-ing sword, turning every way, to keep the way ofthe tree of life.Chapter 4And  Adam  knew  Eve  his  wife;  who  conceivedand brought forth Cain, saying:  I have gotten aman through God.2And  again  she  brought  forth  his  brotherAbel.   And  Abel  was  a  shepherd,  and  Cain  ahusbandman.3And it came to pass after many days, thatCain offered,  of the fruits of the earth,  gifts tothe Lord.4Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock,and  of  their  fat:  and  the  Lord  had  respect  toAbel, and to his offerings.5But to Cain and his offerings he had no re-spect:  and  Cain  was  exceeding  angry,  and  hiscountenance fell.6And  the  Lord  said  to  him:  Why  art  thouangry?  and why is thy countenance fallen?7If thou do well, shalt thou not receive?  butif  ill,  shall  not  sin  forthwith  be  present  at  thedoor?  but the lust thereof shall be under thee,and thou shalt have dominion over it.8And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us goforth abroad.  And when they were in the field,Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slewhim.9And  the  Lord  said  to  Cain:  Where  is  thybrother  Abel?   And  he  answered:  I  know  not:am I my brother’s keeper?10And he said to him: What hast thou done?Book of Genesis7the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me fromthe earth.11Now therefore cursed shalt thou be uponthe earth, which hath opened her mouth and re-cieved the blood of thy brother at thy hand.12When thou shalt till it,  it shall not yieldto thee its fruit:  a fugitive and a vagabond shaltthou be upon the earth.13And Cain said to the Lord:  My iniquity isgreater than that I may deserve pardon.14Behold thou dost cast me out this day fromthe face of the earth, and from thy face I shall behid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive onthe earth:  every one therefore that findeth me,shall kill me.15And  the  Lord  said  to  him:   No,  it  shallnot  so  be:  but  whosoever  shall  kill  Cain,  shallbe punished sevenfold.  And the Lord set a markupon Cain, that whosoever found him should notkill him.16And  Cain  went  out  from  the  face  of  theLord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at theeast side of Eden.17And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived,and brought forth Henoch:  and he built a city,and called the name thereof by the name of hisson Henoch.18And  Henoch  begot  Irad,  and  Irad  be-got Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, andMathusael begot Lamech,19Who took two wives:  the name of the onewas Ada, and the name of the other Sella.20And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was thefather of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.21And his brother’s name was Jubal:  he wasthe father of them that play upon the harp andthe organs.22Sella  also  brought  forth  Tubalcain,  whowas  a  hammerer  and  artificer  in  every  work  ofbrass and iron.  And the sister of Tubalcain wasNoema.23And  Lamech  said  to  his  wives  Ada  andSella:  Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hear-ken to my speech:  for I have slain a man to thewounding of myself, and a stripling to my ownbruising.24Sevenfold  vengeance  shall  be  taken  forCain:  but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.25Adam  also  knew  his  wife  again:  and  shebrought forth a son,  and called his name Seth,saying:   God  hath  given  me  another  seed  forAbel, whom Cain slew.26But  to  Seth  also  was  born  a  son,  whomhe called Enos:  this man began to call upon thename of the Lord.Chapter 5This is the book of the generation of Adam.  Inthe day that God created man, he made him tothe likeness of God.2He  created  them  male  and  female;   andblessed  them:  and called  their name  Adam,  inthe day when they were created.3And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years,and begot a son to his own image and likeness,and called his name Seth.4And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth,were eight hundred years: and he begot sons anddaughters.5And all the time that Adam lived, came tonine hundred and thirty years, and he died.6Seth also lived a hundred and five years, andbegot Enos.7And  Seth  lived  after  he  begot  Enos,  eighthundred  and  seven  years,  and  begot  sons  anddaughters.

8Book of Genesis8And all the days of Seth were nine hundredand twelve years, and he died.9And  Enos  lived  ninety  years,  and  begotCainan.10After  whose  birth  he  lived  eight  hundredand fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.11And all the days of Enos were nine hundredand five years, and he died.12And Cainan lived seventy years, and begotMalaleel.13And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel,eight  hundred  and  forty  years,  and  begot  sonsand daughters.14And all the days of Cainan were nine hun-dred and ten years, and he died.15And Malaleel lived sixty-five years and be-got Jared.16And  Malaleel  lived  after  he  begot  Jared,eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sonsand daughters.17And  all  the  days  of  Malaleel  were  eighthundred and ninety-five years, and he died.18And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-twoyears, and begot Henoch.19And  Jared  lived  after  he  begot  Henoch,eight hundred years, and begot sons and daugh-ters.20And all the days of Jared were nine hun-dred and sixty-two years, and he died.21And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and be-got Mathusala.22And Henoch walked with God:  and livedafter he begot Mathusala, three hundred years,and begot sons and daughters.23And all the days of Henoch were three hun-dred and sixty-five years.24And he walked with God, and was seen nomore:  because God took him.25And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.26And   Mathlusala   lived   after   he   begotLamech,  seven  hundred  and  eighty-two  years,and begot sons and daughters.27And  all  the  days  of  Mathusala  were  ninehundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.28And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.29And  he  called  his  name  Noe,   saying:This same shall comfort us from the works andlabours  of  our  hands  on  the  earth,  which  theLord hath cursed.30And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, fivehundred  and  ninety-five  years,  and  begot  sonsand daughters.31And all the days of Lamech came to sevenhundred  and  seventy-seven  years,  and  he  died.And Noe,  when he was five hundred years old,begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.Chapter 6And after that men began to be multiplied uponthe earth, and daughters were born to them,2The  sons  of  God  seeing  the  daughters  ofmen,  that  they  were  fair,  took  to  themselveswives of all which they chose.3And God said:  My spirit shall not remainin man for ever, because he is flesh, and his daysshall be a hundred and twenty years.4Now  giants  were  upon  the  earth  in  thosedays.  For after the sons of God went in to thedaughters of men,  and they brought forth chil-dren,  these  are  the  mighty  men  of  old,  men  ofrenown.5And God seeing that the wickedness of menwas great on the earth, and that all the thoughtof their heart was bent upon evil at all times,6It repented him that he had made man onthe earth.  And being touched inwardly with sor. Book of Genesis9row of heart,7He  said:  I  will  destroy  man,  whom  I  havecreated,  from  the  face  of  the  earth,  from  maneven to beasts, from the creeping thing even tothe  fowls  of  the  air,  for  it  repenteth  me  that  Ihave made them.8But Noe found grace before the Lord.9These are the generations of Noe:  Noe wasa  just  and  perfect  man  in  his  generations,  hewalked with God.10And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, andJapheth.11And the earth was corrupted before God,and was filled with iniquity.12And  when  God  had  seen  that  the  earthwas corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its wayupon the earth),13He  said  to  Noe:   The  end  of  all  flesh  iscome before me, the earth is filled with iniquitythrough them, and I will destroy them with theearth.14Make thee an ark of timber planks:  thoushalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shaltpitch it within and without.15And thus shalt thou make it.  The lengthof  the  ark  shall  be  three  hundred  cubits:   thebreadth  of  it  fifty  cubits,  and  the  height  of  itthirty cubits.16Thou shalt make a window in the ark, andin a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it:  and thedoor of the ark thou shalt set in the side:  withlower, middle chambers, and third stories shaltthou make it.17Behold, I will bring the waters of a greatflood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, whereinis the breath of life under heaven. All things thatare in the earth shall be consumed.18And I will establish my covenant with thee,and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thysons,  and  thy  wife,  and  the  wives  of  thy  sonswith thee.19And  of  every  living  creature  of  all  flesh,thou shalt bring two of a sort into the ark, thatthey  may  live  with  thee:  of  the  male  sex,  andthe female.20Of  fowls  according  to  their  kind,  and  ofbeasts  in  their  kind,  and  of  every  thing  thatcreepeth on the earth according to its kind:  twoof every sort shall go in with thee, that they maylive.21Thou shalt take unto thee of all food thatmay be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee:and it shall be food for thee and them.22And  Noe  did  all  things  which  God  com-manded him.Chapter 7And the Lord said to him:  Go in, thou and allthy house, into the ark:  for thee I have seen justbefore me in this generation.2Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, themale and the female.3But of the beasts that are unclean two andtwo, the male and the female.  Of the fowls alsoof the air seven and seven, the male and the fe-male:  that seed may be saved upon the face ofthe whole earth.4For yet a while, and after seven days, I willrain upon the earth forty days and forty nights:and  I  will  destroy  every  substance  that  I  havemade, from the face of the earth.5And Noe did all things which the Lord hadcommanded him.6And he was six hundred years old, when thewaters of the flood overflowed the earth.7And Noe went in and his sons, his wife andthe wives of his sons with him into the ark, be-10Book of Genesiscause of the waters of the flood.8And  of  beasts  clean  and  unclean,  and  offowls, and of every thing that moveth upon theearth,9Two and two went in to Noe into the ark,male  and  female,  as  the  Lord  had  commandedNoe.10And after the seven days were passed, thewaters of the flood overflowed the earth.11In the six hundredth year of the life of Noe,in the second month, in the seventeenth day ofthe  month,  all  the  fountains  of  the  great  deepwere  broken  up,  and  the  floodgates  of  heavenwere opened:12And the rain fell upon the earth forty daysand forty nights.13In  the  selfsame  day  Noe,  and  Sem,  andCham, and Japheth, his sons:  his wife, and thethree wives of his sons with them, went into theark.14They and every beast according to its kind,and all the cattle in their kind, and every thingthat  moveth  upon  the  earth,  according  to  itskind,  and  every  fowl  according  to  its  kind,  allbirds, and all that fly,15Went in to Noe into the ark, two and twoof all flesh, wherein was the breath of life.16And they that went in, went in male andfemale of all flesh, as God had commanded him:and the Lord shut him in on the outside.17And  the  flood  was  forty  days  upon  theearth:  and  the  waters  increased,  and  lifted  upthe ark on high from the earth.18For they overflowed exceedingly:  and filledall  on  the  face  of  the  earth:   and  the  ark  wascarried upon the waters.19And the waters prevailed beyond measureupon the earth:  and all the high mountains un-der the whole heaven were covered.20The  water  was  fifteen  cubits  higher  thanthe mountains which it covered.21And  all  flesh  was  destroyed  that  movedupon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle, andof beasts,  and of all creeping things that creepupon the earth:  and all men.22And all things wherein there is the breathof life on the earth, died.23And  he  destroyed  all  the  substance  thatwas  upon  the  earth,  from  man  even  to  beast,and the creeping things and fowls of the air: andthey  were  destroyed  from  the  earth:   and  Noeonly remained, and they that were with him inthe ark.24And the waters prevailed upon the earth ahundred and fifty days.Chapter 8And  God  remembered  Noe,  and  all  the  livingcreatures, and all the cattle which were with himin the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth,and the waters were abated:2The  fountains  also  of  the  deep,  and  thefloodgates of heaven, were shut up, and the rainfrom heaven was restrained.3And the waters returned from off the earthgoing and coming:  and they began to be abatedafter a hundred and fifty days.4And  the  ark  rested  in  the  seventh  month,the seven and twentieth day of the month, uponthe mountains of Armenia.5And the waters were going and decreasinguntil the tenth month:  for in the tenth month,the first day of the month, the tops of the moun-tains appeared.6And after that forty days were passed, Noeopening  the  window  of  the  ark,  which  he  hadmade, sent forth a raven:Book of Genesis117Which went forth and did not return, till thewaters were dried up upon the earth.8He sent forth also a dove after him, to see ifthe waters had now ceased upon the face of theearth.9But  she  not  finding  where  her  foot  mightrest, returned to him into the ark: for the waterswere upon the whole earth:  and he put forth hishand, and caught her, and brought her into theark.10And  having  waited  yet  seven  other  days,he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.11And she came to him in the evening carry-ing a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, inher mouth.  Noe therefore understood that thewaters were ceased upon the earth.12And he stayed yet other seven days:  andhe sent forth the dove, which returned not anymore unto him.13Therefore  in  the  six  hundredth  and  firstyear, the first month, the first day of the month,the  waters  were  lessened  upon  the  earth,  andNoe opening the covering of the ark, looked, andsaw that the face of the earth was dried.14In the second month, the seven and twen-tieth day of the month, the earth was dried.15And God spoke to Noe, saying:16Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thysons and the wives of thy sons with thee.17All living things that are with thee of allflesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creep-ing things that creep upon the earth, bring outwith  thee,  and  go  ye  upon  the  earth:  increaseand multiply upon it.18So Noe went out, he and his sons:  his wife,and the wives of his sons with him.19And all living things, and cattle, and creep-ing things that creep upon the earth, accordingto their kinds went out of the ark.20And Noe built an altar unto the Lord:  andtaking  of  all  cattle  and  fowls  that  were  clean,offered holocausts upon the altar.21And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, andsaid: I will no more curse the earth for the sake ofman:  for the imagination and thought of man’sheart are prone to evil from his youth:  thereforeI will no more destroy every living soul as I havedone.22All the days of the earth, seedtime and har-vest,  cold  and  heat,  summer  and  winter,  nightand day, shall not cease.Chapter 9And  God  blessed  Noe  and  his  sons.    And  hesaid to them:  Increase, and multiply, and fill theearth.2And let the fear and dread of you be uponall the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowlsof the air, and all that move upon the earth:  allthe fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.3And  every  thing  that  moveth,  and  livethshall be meat for you:  even as the green herbshave I delivered them all to you:4Saving that flesh with blood you shall noteat.5For I will require the blood of your lives atthe hand of every beast, and at the hand of man,at the hand of every man, and of his brother, willI require the life of man.6Whosoever shall shed man’s blood, his bloodshall be shed:  for man was made to the image ofGod.7But increase you and multiply, and go uponthe earth and fill it.8Thus also said God to Noe, and to his sonswith him:

12Book of Genesis9Behold  I  will  establish  my  covenant  withyou, and with your seed after you:10And with every living soul that is with you,as well in all birds, as in cattle and beasts of theearth, that are come forth out of the ark, and inall the beasts of the earth.11I will establish my covenant with you, andall flesh shall be no more destroyed with the wa-ters of a flood, neither shall there be from hence-forth a flood to waste the earth.12And  God  said:   This  is  the  sign  of  thecovenant which I give between me and you, andto every living soul that is with you, for perpet-ual generations.13I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shallbe  the  sign  of  a  covenant  between  me  and  be-tween the earth.14And when I shall cover the sky with clouds,my bow shall appear in the clouds:15And  I  will  remember  my  covenant  withyou,  and  with  every  living  soul  that  bearethflesh:   and  there  shall  no  more  be  waters  of  aflood to destroy all flesh.16And the bow shall be in the clouds, and Ishall see it, and shall remember the everlastingcovenant, that was made between God and everyliving soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.17And  God  said  to  Noe:  This  shall  be  thesign  of  the  covenant,  which  I  have  established,between me and all flesh upon the earth.18And the sons of Noe, who came out of theark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth:  and Chamis the father of Chanaan.19These three are the sons of Noe:  and fromthese  was  all  mankind  spread  over  the  wholeearth.20And Noe a husbandman began to till theground, and planted a vineyard.21And drinking of the wine was made drunk,and was uncovered in his tent.22Which when Cham the father of Chanaanhad seen, to wit, that his father’s nakedness wasuncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.23But  Sem  and  Japheth  put  a  cloak  upontheir shoulders, and going backward, covered thenakedness  of  their  father:  and  their  faces  wereturned  away,  and  they  saw  not  their  father’snakedness.24And Noe awaking from the wine, when hehad learned what his younger son had done tohim,25He said:  Cursed be Chanaan, a servant ofservants shall he be unto his brethren.26And he said:  Blessed be the Lord God ofSem, be Chanaan his servant.27May  God  enlarge  Japheth,  and  may  hedwell in the tents of Sem,  and Chanaan be hisservant.28And  Noe  lived  after  the  flood  three  hun-dred and fifty years.29And  all  his  days  were  in  the  whole  ninehundred and fifty years:  and he died.Chapter 10These  are  the  generations  of  the  sons  of  Noe:Sem, Cham, and Japheth:  and unto them sonswere born after the flood.2The  sons  of  Japheth:  Gomer,  and  Magog,and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch,and Thiras.3And  the  sons  of  Gomer:Ascenez  andRiphath and Thogorma.4And the sons of Javan:  Elisa and Tharsis,Cetthim and Dodanim.5By these were divided the islands of the Gen-tiles  in  their  lands,  every  one  according  to  histongue and their families in their nations. 

Book of Genesis15Chapter 12And  the  Lord  said  to  Abram:  Go  forth  out  ofthy  country,  and  from  thy  kindred,  and  out  ofthy father’s house, and come into the land whichI shall shew thee.2And I will make of thee a great nation, and Iwill bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thoushalt be blessed.3I will bless them that bless thee, and cursethem that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all thekindreds of the earth be blessed.4So Abram went out as the Lord had com-manded  him,  and  Lot  went  with  him:  Abramwas  seventy-five  years  old  when  he  went  forthfrom Haran.5And  he  took  Sarai  his  wife,  and  Lot  hisbrother’s son, and all the substance which theyhad gathered, and the souls which they had got-ten in Haran:  and they went out to go into theland of Chanaan. And when they were come intoit,6Abram passed through the country unto theplace  of  Sichem,  as  far  as  the  noble  vale:  nowthe Chanaanite was at that time in the land.7And the Lord appeared to Abram, and saidto him:  To thy seed will I give this land.  Andhe built there an altar to the Lord, who had ap-peared to him.8And passing on from thence to a mountain,that  was  on  the  east  side  of  Bethel,  he  therepitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, andHai on the east:  he built there also an altar tothe Lord, and called upon his name.9And  Abram  went  forward,  going  and  pro-ceeding on to the south.10And there came a famine in the country:and  Abram  went  down  into  Egypt,  to  sojournthere:  for  the  famine  was  very  grievous  in  theland.11And when he was near to enter into Egypt,he said to Sarai his wife:  I know that thou art abeautiful woman:12And  that  when  the  Egyptians  shall  seethee,  they  will  say:   She  is  his  wife:   and  theywill kill me, and keep thee.13Say,  therefore,  I pray thee,  that thou artmy sister:  that I may be well used for thee, andthat my soul may live for thy sake.14And  when  Abram  was  come  into  Egypt,the Egyptians saw the woman that she was verybeautiful.15And the princes told Pharao, and praisedher before him:  and the woman was taken intothe house of Pharao.16And  they  used  Abram  well  for  her  sake.And  he  had  sheep  and  oxen  and  he  asses,  andmen servants, and maid servants, and she asses,and camels.17But  the  Lord  scourged  Pharao  and  hishouse   with   most   grievous   stripes   for   Sarai,Abram’s wife.18And Pharao called Abram, and said to him:What is this that thou hast done to me?  Whydidst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?19For what cause didst thou say, she was thysister,  that I might take her to my wife?   Nowtherefore there is thy wife, take her, and go thyway.20And Pharao gave his men orders concern-ing Abram:  and they led him away and his wife,and all that he had.Chapter 13And  Abram  went  up  out  of  Egypt,  he  and  hiswife, and all that he had, and Lot with him intothe south.

16Book of Genesis2And he was very rich in possession of goldand silver.3And he returned by the way, that he came,from the south to Bethel, to the place where be-fore he had pitched his tent between Bethel andHai,4In the place of the altar which he had madebefore, and there he called upon the name of theLord.5But  Lot  also,  who  was  with  Abram,  hadflocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.6Neither was the land able to bear them, thatthey  might  dwell  together:  for  their  substancewas great, and they could not dwell together.7Whereupon also there arose a strife betweenthe herdsmen of Abram and of Lot.  And at thattime the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelledin that country.8Abram therefore said to Lot:  Let there beno quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee,and  between  my  herdsmen  and  thy  herdsmen:for we are brethren.9Behold the whole land is before thee: departfrom me, I pray thee:  if thou wilt go to the lefthand,  I  will  take  the  right:  if  thou  choose  theright hand, I will pass to the left.10And  Lot  lifting  up  his  eyes,  saw  all  thecountry  about  the  Jordan,  which  was  wateredthroughout,  before  the  Lord  destroyed  Sodomand Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, andlike Egypt as one comes to Segor.11And Lot chose to himself the country aboutthe Jordan, and he departed from the east:  andthey were separated one brother from the other.12Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan:  andLot abode in the towns, that were about the Jor-dan, and dwelt in Sodom.13And the men of Sodom were very wicked,and sinners before the face of the Lord beyondmeasure.14And  the  Lord  said  to  Abram,  after  Lotwas separated from him:  Lift up thy eyes,  andlook from the place wherein thou now art, to thenorth and to the south,  to the east and to thewest.15All the land which thou seest, I will give tothee, and to thy seed for ever.16And I will make thy seed as the dust of theearth:  if any man be able to number the dust ofthe earth,  he shall be able to number thy seedalso.17Arise  and  walk  through  the  land  in  thelength, and the breadth thereof:  for I will give itto thee.18So  Abram  removing  his  tent,  came,  anddwelt by the vale of Mambre, which is in Hebron:and he built there an altar to the Lord.Chapter 14And it came to pass at that time, that Amraphel,king  of  Sennaar,  and  Arioch,  king  of  Pontus,and Chodorlahomor,  king of the Elamites,  andThadal, king of nations,2Made war against Bara, king of Sodom, andagainst  Bersa,  king  of  Gomorrha,  and  againstSennaab, king of Adama, and against Semeber,king  of  Seboim,  and  against  the  king  of  Bala,which is Segor.3All these came together into the woodlandvale, which now is the salt sea.4For they had served Chodorlahomor twelveyears,  and  in  the  thirteenth  year  they  revoltedfrom him.5And in the fourteenth year came Chodorla-homor, and the kings that were with him:  andthey  smote  the  Raphaim  in  Astarothcarnaim,and the Zuzim with them, and the Emim in Saveof Cariathaim.

Book of Genesis176And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir,even  to  the  plains  of  Pharan,  which  is  in  thewilderness.7And they returned,  and came to the foun-tain  of  Misphat,  the  same  is  Cades:  and  theysmote all the country of the Amalecites, and theAmorrhean that dwelt in Asasonthamar.8And the king of Sodom, and the king of Go-morrha,  and  the  king  of  Adama,  and  the  kingof Seboim, and the king of Bala, which is Segor,went out:  and they set themselves against themin battle array, in the woodland vale:9To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of theElamites, and Thadal king of nations, and Am-raphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pon-tus:  four kings against five.10Now the woodland vale had many pits ofslime.   And  the  king  of  Sodom,  and  the  kingof Gomorrha turned their backs, and were over-thrown  there:  and  they  that  remained,  fled  tothe mountain.11And  they  took  all  the  substance  of  theSodomites, and Gomorrhites, and all their vict-uals, and went their way:12And Lot also, the son of Abram’s brother,who dwelt in Sodom, and his substance.13And  behold  one,  that  had  escaped,  toldAbram  the  Hebrew,  who  dwelt  in  the  vale  ofMambre  the  Amorrhite,  the  brother  of  Escol,and  the  brother  of  Aner:   for  these  had  madea league with Abram.14Which when Abram had heard, to wit, thathis brother Lot was taken,  he numbered of theservants  born  in  his  house,  three  hundred  andeighteen,  well appointed:  and pursued them toDan.15And dividing his company, he rushed uponthem in the night, and defeated them:  and pur-sued them as far as Hoba,  which is on the lefthand of Damascus.16And he brought back all the substance, andLot his brother, with his substance, the womenalso, and the people.17And the king of Sodom went out to meethim,  after  he  returned  from  the  slaughter  ofChodorlahomor, and of the kings that were withhim in the vale of Save, which is the king’s vale.18But Melchisedech, the king of Salem, bring-ing forth bread and wine, for he was the priestof the most high God,19Blessed him, and said:  Blessed be Abramby the most high God, who created heaven andearth.20And  blessed  be  the  most  high  God,  bywhose protection, the enemies are in thy hands.And he gave him the tithes of all.21And  the  king  of  Sodom  said  to  Abram:Give me the persons, and the rest take to thyself.22And he answered him:  I lift up my handto the Lord God the most high, the possessor ofheaven and earth,23That  from  the  very  woofthread  unto  theshoe latchet,  I will not take of any things thatare thine, lest thou say:  I have enriched Abram.24Except such things as the young men haveeaten, and the shares of the men that came withme, Aner, Escol, and Mambre:  these shall taketheir shares.Chapter 15Now when these things were done, the word ofthe  Lord  came  to  Abram  by  a  vision,  saying:Fear  not,  Abram,  I  am  thy  protector,  and  thyreward exceeding great.2And Abram said:  Lord God, what wilt thougive  me?

Recently I've gotten into university against my own will because my parents believe that university is the only way I can get by in life and I believe it too, but it's been awful for me, I hate my classes and I don't like showing up there. I've been able to make a few friends which made me feel better but they've abandoned me and are only getting closer and closer as I watch them from afar every day. I don't really understand how it happened. Me and one friend in the group had a fight and I was wrong but was too stubborn to admit it, but aside from that, I don't really recall anything bad happening between us, but they've all just started being rude to me and distant, I reached out saying I didn't understand why it was happening and they all ignored me. I tried to reach out in DMs again and one person told me how toxic I was and that she felt like she was losing freedom, but I've never tried controlling her and I tried my best to be supportive, I reached out when she was very down with support, I shared very intimate parts of my life with them.  


I don't really know if I have been toxic or not. I was really aggressive back in the day, I had a troubled childhood, even though it's not an excuse, I just tried working on myself and I can't seem to be enough. I am falling behind classes and I can't get anything done. I feel terrible all the time but my parents won't let me drop out and I honestly don't see any other options. Every day I think about my friends but I feel like tehy just mock me in secret, I feel isolated by my peers and misunderstood by my family. I feel like the only way to escape is to die, that way life won't be difficult anymore.

204613,"Desperately want love but I'm asexualI've been single almost my entire adult life. The sole exception was a year where I had a married female boss twice my age force me into a sexual relationship where I was emotionally and sexually abused for a year. So far she's the only person who's ever claimed to love me and was willing to look past the fact that I'm asexual (though granted she just took what she wanted).

Recently I was dating a girl who I thought I was hitting it off with. Three dates, great conversation, having fun, last night we were cuddling on a couch and kissing. I felt attracted to her in a way I've never felt attracted to a woman before. Then this morning I get a text from her saying she doesn't feel a romantic spark and is not interested in going any further. I blame the fact that thanks to my asexuality I'm not able to escalate intimacy and flirting because I'm just not that interested and as a result can't really fake it well enough to keep girls interested.

I nearly left work to go purchase a shotgun and end things. I'm convinced I'll be alone forever. Dating just isn't working out, and it takes a lot of money, time, and emotional investment just to get predictably shot down every time when it reaches the point of requiring sexual advances. While I'm fine with sexual activities, I can't offer sex because I can't get hard thanks to lack of arousal.

I desperately want a relationship. I want to love someone, be loved by someone, cuddle, basically do everything couples do. I'd have sex if I could. But it's never going to happen. Asexuals are very rare and usually aren't my type (living very alternative lifestyles whereas I just want someone ""normal""). Friendships aren't a substitute; I'm 30 years old, people my age are usually coupled up. Pets aren't a substitute; a dog may love you, but it's more like a young child than a partner.

i've been suicidal for a couple years now. it comes and goes, i've attempted a half dozen times or more by now but have only gotten close twice. i dont want to die. i really dont. but everything has just been so empty, things have been going downhill, everything in my life just keeps going wrong and i'm scared. i dont want to suffer anymore.

i'm gonna try to keep this short but i guess context is good. uh... i ran away from an abusive stepfather at 17, lived on my own for a while. had a slew of unstable and unhealthy relationships, abuse abound on all sides. i was a fucking shit person. had a few roommates, moved around a couple times. i had to quit working at doctors recommendation due to my mental health absolutely crashing after mistreatment at work and a bad breakup, and i've been on british columbia (canada) welfare ever since. its not much to get by on lol, i can pay a tiny portion of rent on places and i usually only eat once or twice. last year a guy i met online and got close to (really close) wanted me to move in with him, he'd take care of me, help me work, etc. i loved him endlessly but once i moved in it turned into a nightmare. sexual exploitation, gaslighting, manipulation, and threats of dumping me on the street or killing me if i said a word negative about him or affected his career.

i managed to get out with the help of some friends and lived on their couch for a while. things were rough from time to time, my anxiety is awful and i tend to lash out easily or see everything as a threat so eventually i moved out. things were fine, i guess. my relationships (i'm polyamorous... or i was? i think I need a fucking break) were not great, kinda unstable, i broke up with one of my partners after our BPD just kept bouncing off of eachother and we were treating eachother like shit. one of my other partners was pressuring me to move down to oregon with her and get married, but i didnt feel safe doing so, i didnt trust anyone and after us just getting more and more miserable i broke off the engagement and tried to just focus on my growth. I wanted to heal and get better. i wanted a stable relationship.

things went okay for a while. i reconnected really well with my one remaining partner, but stress was building up. money was always tight. i was miserable when we werent spending time together. I felt like she never tried to help me when i was struggling and i just bottled it all up. then i caught her cheating on me with my friend's girlfriend while i was sleeping right next to them. twice, two weeks apart. My girlfriend was remorseful. I forgave her - i'm on the asexual spectrum and i know i dont do a whole lot, she realized she messed up, and it was my friends gf who kept pushing her. we tried to move past it but i kept... bottling my feelings up. blaming myself. i didnt do enough physical things with her, so she wanted more.  but i knew it was a breach in communication. i didnt know how to deal with it  and eventually after hanging out with her, my friend and their gf for a night and hearing them flirt with eachother and (in my mind) pretend nothing happened, i broke down.

at first i was just tryint to explain how i felt. tell them that i felt walked over and hurt. but i started breaking down and spiraling. everything and everyone was an enemy and i started lashing out. the friends gf just kept sneering at me - her face haunts my nightmares - she kept acting like nothing was wrong. it was my fault. how dare i get angry. it ended in yelling and tears and we went our separate ways for a while. my friend and i had been planning on moving in together, and after a lot of talk we thought it would all still work out. I just needed space from that girl.

fast forward to this week. I was down visiting my girlfriend for Christmas, and i get a message from my friend and roommate saying that he's kicking me out on new years. his girlfriend had started hanging out with my exes and they all talked about how abusive and horrible i was (this is all stuff that i'm very aware of and those relationships ended over eight months ago. i've come a long way). But she decided she hated me, and gave my friend an ultimatum. kick me out, or leave. I stood my ground, my name is on the lease, i'm not going anywhere, but my friend is leaving. maybe at the end of next month, i don't know. they arent talking to me right now. stress builds. the home that i had just moved into two weeks previous and just finished unpacking... is now a nightmare. i feel unsafe. i have nowhere to go. no friends, no family, and definitely no money.

stress builds more. i'm shutting myself off from my girlfriend while we're trying to spend christmas together. i cant sleep, but she doesnt seem to care and just would roll over and sleep. things just kept getting worse and worse. i've been falling apart all week and last nitht (christmas! yay!) we had a disagreement and i started to cry. not a fight. no yelling. but it was too much for her. she left and didnt come back for a while. i managed to calm down and i apologized profusely but she told me she just cant do this anymore. its too much stress. my breakdowns and all the stress of my living situation and now my friend and his girlfriend hating me(?). just too much.

so we're done. the only real thing that i was holding onto. my partner is gone. my home will be gone. i've lost my friends, i've been cheated on more times than i can count, i have nowhere to go and i just. i dont see any good coming out of this.

this is all a SUPER watered down version of my life. i've tried to be as upfront and honest as i can but for time's sake its a bit of a mess.

i just dont know what to do. so now i'm here, writing out a post on a subreddit i've never seen before, hoping that. maybe someone has something that could keep me going. maybe i can build hope.

My girlfriend was an amazing person and I think about her everyday there’s nothing I wouldn’t give to just get some real closure instead of having to get someone else to break up with her for me because I tried to figure out a way to go behind my parents back and talk to them anyway but there was nothing I could do so I wasn’t gonna let her date me when we couldn’t talk so I got my best friend to break up with her for me before I said goodbye to him. I don’t know how to get over her and don’t know if I ever will I also don’t know if I will get over my best friend he was an amazing person everyday at school we’d fuck around do dumb shit and have fun playing video games (mainly fallout and sometimes uno) and yell at the top of our lungs raging it was fun. We made a promise to never give each other up and I intend to keep it because him and my girlfriend are the only people I love that aren’t family and I count the days till maybe I can see them both again. I remember me and my best friend sitting in science in 8th grade and we always ate Chex mix halfway through the class we’d split a small bag and I looked over and he was choking so hard face red as hell and me being the supportive best friend I am laughed at him as hard as I could then hit him on the back a couple times. Ah and my girlfriend we were in a class one day and the teacher handed out a paper for all the class to complete but of course instead of doing the work we wrote sentences to each other filling up her paper front and back and mine. There are countless other amazing times and I’ll never forget any of them because the chance I was given to meet those people was better then winning the lottery it was a chance that I will never be able to recapture.

I'm skinny, not athletic and I get the shit beat out of me at karate tournaments due to the large height and weight difference. I lack intelligence so I can't get any high grades, I fail a lot.

My height is evident in everything about me.

I cry easily, I give up easily, I used to try as hard as I can to pace with others ahead of me or surpass them but I fail anyway. Something is always there to stop me. 

I am unsociable and lose my patience easily. I once cried for a month because I called a girl cute and a whole class of girls blocked me, not because of my height, because they all thought I was weird and creepy, and people only told me they did after they blocked me.

204662,My take on suicide.It’s never too late? For what? Life? It’s not about being happy or sad. It’s not about having a good life or a bad one. The idea has been there since the start and will stay till the end. Suicide that is! No matter how good things are. No matter how bad they are. There’s still the ideation. It doesn’t go away. It’s like being locked in a prison in your own head. One you can’t escape from no matter how hard you try. It’s there to stay. No matter what meds they give you. No matter what anyone says to you. No matter who is there for you. It stays. It doesn’t change. It’s being set free. To be at peace. To be at That’s the endgame. That’s the peace we all long for.  It’s not really something to fear. Of course we all have so much to live for. No shit! How many lives can we change? So many. So many smiles. So many letdowns. There is no peace in life for the ones who have this obsession. Only in death will we be set free. It’s selfish to have those who care to hold on. They are the ones who need to let go. I’m not saying suicide is the way out. For most it’s the exact opposite. It’s a matter of philosophy I suppose. How do you people feel? External situations cause the idea? Or is it.. just there? ,suicide

204667,"Just venting I guess. Kinda long.  Its crazy how some of the survival post- you know the ones that say “I’m alive because X”- those ones makes me the most depressed. Everyone’s always like “I’m alive because of my mother, my child, my partner, my friend.” 

What if you have none of those. Like for me for example. I don’t have a child, my father has passed, my mother isn’t dead- but dead to me, I’m not close/in contact to any family, no siblings,  all my old friends have moved on with their lives long ago, and I’m not close to anyone around me. Because of the culture I live in, its incredibly hard to make friends here. 

Last week I deleted all my social media, turned off my phone for a solid week, and didn’t really leave my apartment. The only two people to notice anything was wrong was my boss (because I missed a shift) and one of my professors (only because I missed an in class assignment that affects my grade). 

Earlier last year I was close to some of the girls in my apartment. However, when I became friends with one of these girl’s brothers (she has like 5 siblings), she flipped out and stopped talking to me. When I asked her what was going on she couldn’t give me a reason she was so against my friendship with her brother. It changed the dynamic of the apartment a lot. She made it clear that whether I ended the relationship with her brother or not that she wouldn’t have a friendship with me regardless. During this time, she talked to a lot of the other girls in the apartment about it and elicited a lot of sympathy from them in the process. The other girls had the inclination that “well its her brother, so she can decide if you can be friends with him or not.” Which, I don’t think they realized that outside of them, I didn’t/don’t feel close to anyone else but her brother at that time.

I guess I felt backed into a corner.

So, I stayed friends with him. However, soon after this, things turned a bit romantic with the brother. We spent a lot of time together and developed a great friendship and one day things just shifted. Things were really great. While, I wasn’t as close to my room mates anymore and the sister flat out refused to acknowledge my existence (to the point I could directly ask her a question and she wouldn't acknowledge me), at least I had a good friendship turned relationship with the brother. He started telling me he loved me, and I waited a while to reciprocate that, but when I did, I really really meant it. 

However, one day out of the blue he ghosted me. I was incredibly hurt. I went to his apartment a few days after and he told me he didn’t have feelings for me and never did. I had to beg him for an hour to even talk to me and tell me what the hell was going on. In my view, I haven’t been this close to someone in this particular way in a very long time if ever. 

I guess it really just perpetuated what I’ve felt for a long time. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere. I know I don’t make a difference to people. I apparently don’t have the ability to be close to someone and to be important to someone elses life for any significant portion of time, or to connect with someone on a deeper level. 

And its depressing and I’m so tired of it. ",suicide

I checked in with my friends to see if this was solid because they know what happened too and they said it was perfect.

Listen I really care about her she’s very important to me and I don’t wanna lose her over some stupid drama, she misunderstood some things and felt like everyone hates her because of me but that isn’t true, it’s not my fault I never went to other people and talked trash about her I always tell her I defended her and say nice things about her but she always second guesses it.


We talked a little bit after we broke our friendship up cause she knows I was depressed severely or something I don’t know why she would still answer me but I’m glad she does. 

About 4 days ago I finished my apology and I tried asking to ft her and she always told me no cause she was busy or she just couldn’t. I asked her this question at around 9 o’clock and one time I think I asked her in like the morning or something and she said she couldn’t. she wasn’t lying to me and I think she’s starting to go to bed early now, she’s not active on Instagram past 9 pm and I can see cause she’s in my insta dms. I don’t know why this makes me so hesitant and nervous, I constantly overthink the worse that can happen and she just will decline which makes me not even want to call her.

Not depression, since my problem is chronic pain. I'm 19 and have 24/7 muscle pain that's basically incurable on top of a bunch of other shit like fibromyalgia, ibs type stuff. Basically doomed from the moment I was born. So suicide just makes sense now. I've also had anxiety my whole life and depression mostly in the past two years though. That's been the soul sucking depression stage. It's insane how I'm still alive given how emotionally dead I am. Even considering the impact of it since I'm so sick with no real hope I look at suicide as a responsibility. As horrible as that is, for some that's their reality. I guess I'm reaching out on reddit since nothing else helps. Therapy, support, exercise and nothing solves chronic pain. My grades are slipping and I don't know what to do. A disease is eating me alive and I won't let it hurt my potential. So much so that I'll die for it. I'm just so so tired. Every day is faking it.

I’m in chronic pain. I’m always sick. My mom has Alzheimer’s and I know my dad will probably off himself when she dies. My older brother lives with them and cares for them but doesn’t work because of nerve problems. 

I was laid off recently and have limited work options. I live with my boyfriend (35f) in a home he owns. We split bills 50/50.

I’ve fallen behind on bills and I’m really at the end of my rope. Can’t stop thinking about how I should have just died when I was 4 years old and that it was a mistake for me to live. 

I told my boyfriend today as a last resort (I normally don’t “burden” people with my mental health struggles) because I was really desperate. And he made it all about him and  how he can’t keep supporting me and then left the room before completely leaving the house all together.

How can I possibly tell them I contemplate about how soothing suicide seems to me every day? How the hell can I stop feeling sorry for myself and man up and achieve my goals one by one making my life finally work?
I am a disappointment to them. They told me not to worry so much, they told me not to obsess about things, but instead to plan my course of action to get my life in order. But today, it all seems just so damn overwhelming again. I wish I got into an accident and died instantly. I am too weak of a person to fight for life. I fear I will end my life when my parents pass away. That way I will at least not cause them pain:( I feel completely worthless, I hate myself, have nevet loved myself.

If my mom dies, I do not want to live. And to be honest, my mom 'picking' my sister over me also makes me want to die.

204752,"Letter to my therapist. Last thing I'll writeI’m not sure how to start this letter. I’ve been meaning to write it for quite some time now but I’ve kept putting it off. I think it’s because I don’t want to face the consequences of writing something like this. Even as I write this now it has become more and more apparent that there may be no hope for me. I’m scared how you’ll react, of what might happen. And let me say I can completely understand if you don’t want to help me, I wouldn’t want to help me either. Let me try and go back a little to try and make you understand how I got to the state I’m in now.

At around Junior year of high school I thought I had my life figured out. I wanted the “American Dream”, make a decent living, a modest home, a loving wife, and eventually kids. At first, I planned my life to be a bit more ambitious; until it dawned on me that I didn’t need all that excess that so many try to obtain. I thought having a loving family to raise and call my own would be enough. To be able to provide for them, to raise kids, to help them be ready for this world.  By the time I was set to graduate it became something I used to focus myself and to motive me to do things I didn’t want to do. However, I slowly realized that this wasn’t a possibility for me. The idea slowly destroyed me. 

This is very hard to say as I’ve said before, this is truly my deepest and darkest secret. I’m a pedophile. I’ve been trying to rack my brain for a more eloquent way to put it but there’s no way around it. I wish I had some traumatic event to point to that led me to be this way, or maybe a brain tumor to blame, but I don’t think there is an excuse. To society I’m the lowest of the low, and it’s a very odd place to be in. There’s no way for me to really get help, as anyone I would speak to might immediately shun me. I’m not looking for sympathy or forgiveness as I don’t think I deserve either. I want to also get this out of the way, as troubling as it is to talk about. I have never nor will I ever touch a child. The fact that I even have to type that out repulses me. To put myself in that kind of situation. I also want to state that I’m not exclusively attracted to younger women. Young or old it doesn’t seem to matter for me. I don’t really think there’s an easy way to say all of this or if it isn’t even necessary. If I should just stop digging a hole for myself now. 

I don’t know when or why it started but it just did. Maybe it was my exposure to the internet coupled with my own curiosity that got me here. What I do know is I don’t deserve the life I have. Everything I have done or ever will do will forever be tainted by this. I’m afraid I’m already on some list somewhere, that at any moment it will catch up to me. I really don’t see any other option but to die. Any life where I continue on, even if I do get some sort of treatment, will not be one worth living to me. Like I said, everything I do will have a blight on it. I am forever scarred by it and its something I’ll have to carry for the rest of my life. I don’t think I’m prepared to bear that burden much longer. Every time I try and plan for something, or think about my future, I always have it in the back of my mind that it doesn’t matter. That I’ve already ruined my life so what’s the point?

So, at some point I realized that I couldn’t have what I wanted, how could someone like me even raise a child or a family? I’m unfit for that type of life. I trust myself enough to never physically do anything but why should anyone take my word for it? All my life, my friends and family, they always tell me how great of a guy I can be, how one day I’ll make a great dad or uncle, whenever I hear that I want to throw up and kill myself right then and there. I know I’m not a good person because of this. How could I be? I’m not sure there are any options for me, especially where I don’t expose myself to the ones who love me. At this point, this is more about getting it off my chest to someone. I’m certain I’ll be gone fairly soon, so I won’t hold anything back anymore in discussing it. If you’re still reading at this point.

A couple weeks ago when I was at my lowest and started to do more research on suicide, I thought my best option was to shoot myself as that seems to be the most effective way. But there are those horror stories about people who survive. Any weapon I’d have access to would be of a low caliber round which would make my survival of such an attempt more likely. But that same day, as I laid in bed thinking of what might happen, my father brings home a new gun he purchased. One many more times powerful. In a messed\-up way it was like a sign. Now I have no more excuses. I had written a letter to my family and friends to try and explain why I would do something like this. I know my parents will blame themselves, especially my father. I’m not sure I’ll leave it as it may just leave more questions for them to fight about. I really wish there was some sort of assisted suicide program in the States so I wouldn’t have to put everyone through so much trouble.

We discussed people who survive these attempts, how they feel an overwhelming sense of regret they even tried or relief that they lived. I’m positive I’d share a similar sentiment. I don’t want to die, there is much I’d still like to see and do. My best friend is getting married soon and he keeps talking about a future that includes me. What we’ll do for his bachelor party, what’ll happen once he has kids, if and when I get married someday, etc. It pains me to think that I won’t be there for any of it. I feel like my hand is being forced as a result of my own choices. I’ve already buried myself in a mountain of debt and bad choices separate from my main affliction. There are still many things that bother me in this world that would be far to numerous to start talking about here. I’m depressed about a lot of things but obviously the big one is what is really driving my mental state. Maybe I am seeing things through this lens of depression and not thinking clearly. I just don’t think anyone can or is willing to help me. 

I can go on forever but I’ll stop here. I’m not sure if we’ll have our discussion on Sunday, either because you don’t want to, technical issues, or because I don’t have the courage to face the aftermath of finally telling someone. Either way I just want to say thank you. You seem like a genuinely amazing person and therapist. I appreciate you trying to help me even though I may sometimes seem incoherent or my inability to articulate in person the things that are bothering me. I wish you well, and again, thank you.

204753,"Im Just Waiting...Everyday I go on with nothing happening in my life... Im honestly just a waste of talents on a body that doesnt want to live... Here is what Im capable of:

2)Play several insturments
3)Technology loves me and I love it
4) Have an athletic body (but I dont play sports)

204758,"My situation is hopeless. I do not know what to do.My name is Dan.

I am 24 years old, and I have endured a lot of pain. I have Aspergers, I also have Dopa-Responsive Dystonia.

In order to move, I must take L-Dopa; without it, I am mostly incapable of fine motor control and only retain gross motor control. Also, without it, it hurts to walk.  This condition has affected me in various ways; my balance is off so I've never learnt to ride a bike, nor can I run without a high risk of falling over. 

Walking hurts if I do not take it, or take it only a low dose. If I take it on a high dose, I am capable of most movement, but requires I take breaks every few hours as the side effects (sudden sleepiness and/or over-excitability) appear. As such, I am not capable of a great deal of movement, and have subsequently become overweight.

I fought through the problems of Aspergers and depression, I have a few lovely friends in my life. They are good people. Very good people. Kind, considerate...little stupid, but then who isn't?

I had a fiancee. And a small company. And a home and a car and a future.

We were looking at getting married, we were looking at adoption. My ideas for some admittedly mad-science designs were being built. We had a future. A beautiful, beautiful future.

My fiancee decided, however, to go down the path of drugs, and this unfortunately led to him sexually assaulting me once, as well as beating me once or twice. His habits cost me almost everything; what little finances I had left I used up to leave home and him beyond. He took the car, I lost my home. Had to move in with the parents whilst I dealt with crippling debt and the memories of having my dignity removed.

My condition makes working very tricky; I survive on the UK's social security program. Just barely. It's just barely enough to cover the cost of the debts and provide for the bills and food. More often than I like, I've had to make the choice between food or an internet connection.
My parents are kind, and do provide for me, but they have their own debts that are eating away at their lives. 

This is not my first foray into depression; when I was young, I was very depressed that I couldn't do all these things with my brother; I couldn't run, or playfight, or do combat rolls, or anything, except stand, sit or complain when my legs hurt.
My body, at times, does lock up. Like a cage forming around my limbs, locking me down. Can't really do much in the way of sports without risking it; even after going to the gym I need to find somewhere quiet so that I can turn into a bloody statue.

Rage fills me; all those missed opportunities; my body let me down even when my will was as strong as iron. You can't climb trees when your hands have a tendency to let go of whatever they were holding.

He stopped me ending my life quite a few times. Often enough by sitting on my chest and using my head as a bongo, but that's my brother for you.

The other week, my brother took me out on a road trip across Europe to take me to a wedding in Venice, where one of my closest friends was getting married to the love of his life. My brother had also encouraged and supported me in making friends many years ago; I have him to thank for taking me to Venice, protecting me, guiding me, looking after me, and even helping me build strong friendships.
I could've never afforded it; I couldn't of arranged half of it and he ensured that even my sensory issues were taken care of.

I loved every second of the trip, but I tried to hide the full extent of my condition from him (we haven't seen each other in quite a few years); Levodopa has side effects after all. I didn't want him to worry about me, I also didn't want him to see me as a cripple he needs to take care of.

He's a very driven man; on that road trip he covered 1400 miles, and he's only been driving for about five months. If he knew I was writing this I strongly suspect he'd tie me up. He (metaphorically) chained up my heart to stop my depression; call it a form of conditioning if you will; he shouts; I go quiet; he orders, I obey. Subconscious snaps at me if I don't.

He wants me to be happy; to be debt free. But my heart died when my finance used me as a cum bucket. My debts are insurmountable; by the time I've cleared off some and bought food, I'm already out of money. 

But I'm in pain; my body, even with L-Dopa, still screws up. Still fucks up. Nosebleeds, confusion, agitation are other side effects. 
So there's a choice; don't take the drug and you can't move. Take it and whilst you can move freely, without the aid of a walking stick or wheelchair, you can't for the life of you figure out how a supermarket works. Or a door, in some cases.

I've been on 23 dates; each date has failed because it seems most people are overly vain; I am no adonis, I admit. Whilst my weight is larger than I'd like, it appears that a lot of people are very focussed on looks. Those few who looked beyond that were unsure if they were homosexual, and the one or two who got over those two problems did not inspire any sort of longing in my heart; all I could see them as were friends.

I can never be half the man my brother is. My condition wears on me and I'll never have the freedoms others take for granted; like your body not suddenly shutting down on you. I'm just stuck at home, writing my heart out to a possibly indifferent audience.

I'm alone, penniless, and I want to die. But I don't want to hurt my brother. I don't want him to suffer. I can't do that to him again; he almost fell apart last time I fell into this deep, dark pit. He put me back together with (if you'll forgive the poetic bit of me here) bits of himself; forging a connection between the shattered bits of my mind. 

He'd never admit to such weakness, but I know him. I know him watching me fall apart almost destroyed him.

I do not know what to do; I'm not strong enough to live, but too much of a coward to die.

I cannot fight this monster in me anymore. I can't fight depression, Aspergers and Dystonia.

If only my finance hadn't hurt me, if only Dystonia hadn't happened...maybe I could of been as brilliant as him. But I'm not; simply a source of pain and embarrassment to him.

I don't deserve a brother like him. The universe has made it clear I don't deserve any sort of happiness. 

So I ask the great Reddit Hivemind...what would you do when your mind is at risk, your body is failing to obey commands, your lover burns your soul and your brother chains down your heart? How can you fight this?

How can I win?

What to do. When the realization finally hits you that you might never be happy. When you lose the love for the people you've known the most like your friends and family and cant seem to get it back. As every attempt to be something fails. As you realize that you lack the desires to leave a fulfilling life, and the only thing on your mind is getting away. you just want the strength to get away from everyone that hurt you, everyone that you no longer care for, because your just unable to. to just be alone. But as your life is crumbling and your mental health worsens, as your body begins to give up on you, is it really worth being alone. if i am to accept that i'll never be happy, if im to keep wasting money on therapy that doesnt help, should i really commit the rest of the year to living alone. do you ever just want to say goodbye to everyone? to cry infront of them and see them one last time before departing? i often fantasize about getting a terminal illness. then i could finally say goodbye to this world and not have to worry about doing it myself. I dont know how long i can do this knowing i'll never be happy, how much money i can continue putting towards therapy when its never worked for me. Because i dont think i suffer from depression. Im just not a person who can be satisfied with life, so im depressed. and now more than ever i wish to let go. because its hard to fight a war you'll never win",suicide

All of my habits are bad and I try to break them when my depression doesn't cripple me but I don't have enough time it seems between my highs and lows to do anything worthwhile. I hate my job, I'm a scrawny fuck working physical labor ~50 hours a week living in whatever hotel is closest to the construction site. I fucked up in High school, didn't care enough, got bullied, developed social anxiety pretty badly. Pretty sure I only have my job working under my dad because he doesn't have the heart to fire me and see me fail worse than I already am. I suck at everything I do, I don't have the wherewithal to do complex tasks anymore because I'm just too apathetic to everything. I make little mistakes every single day that just keep piling up and reinforcing my bad habits / behaviors. My friends and family care about me and I know that but they don't know the extent of my failures and shortcomings because I don't really talk to anyone about my life, mainly because I'm too anxious / scared to. And if they did, they wouldn't understand as I'm pretty sure I'm the only one in my close family who struggles like this, besides my nearly estranged sister. I've had a gun to my head a couple of times, I've walked off from my job to jump into traffic from a bridge, I've tried tying a ligature around my neck but I fuckin pussy out every damn time.

Why the hell am I still here? Am I supposed to keep going like this? Why should I? Are there any ways I can legally commit suicide where I have no control over it so I can't pussy out (In TX)?

I can't see myself growing old or having kids, kids sound absolutely terrible and I can't imagine how I'd ever raise a kid properly, hell I can't even imagine finding anyone I'd want to have kids with. I'm all alone and always have been. And growing old sounds even worse, my mind is a dumpster fire and my body isn't great because I don't eat / sleep right and still go out and destroy it doing physical labor, so why the fuck would I want to be 40+ years old when my body would be failing even more than it is now?

Shit this post is all over the damn place but it's like I said, it feels like I barely have the mental capacity to do anything right anymore. I feel like I'm just fishing for attention and I'm just a lazy fuck who can't get his shit together. But I just genuinely don't think I'm supposed to keep going.

    Things were getting pretty bad (ya know, teen things), and I had made a ""rope"" (in hindsight it probably wasn't even strong enough to hold my weight), anyway I hung it on the tree in our backyard and when my parents asked about me about it I said I was trying to clime it, and they believed me. My plan was to go outside at night when everyone was asleep and hang myself, night after night i would almost do it, but there was always something (I fell asleep too early, I forget to wake up, it's too cold outside, etc.) Anyway I had made up my mind that I would do it that night no matter what happened. 
    It was the afternoon and I was texting a friend and I pretty much told her that I was depressed and hinted at suicide, she got mad at me and I tried to forget about. A few hours later I was laying down on my bed and my dad opens the door and tells me that someone wants to see me, I could tell there was something wrong by the look in his eyes, I was confused (no one really came over) I walk in the living room and see two cops. They pretty much tell me that my friend had called the cops and that she was concerned, (mind you, my family had no idea I was depressed) and so they referred me to a therapist(I never went), and when they were gone my dad gave me a long lecture. I didn't get that she was helping me then and I was mad at her.
    A few days pass and I come up with another way, when everyone is sleeping, I would fill up the bathtub with worm water and slit my rist(gives me chills writing this). So it was like 1:00 pm western time and I did just that, I filled up the tub and layed in it, I sat there for 10 minutes contemplating whether I should do it. I decided on yes and I got the Razer and put it on my wrist, I started the cut and a inch later, something came over me, it was like divine intervention, but I could go through with it, I just couldn't do it.
    I still have times where I would get really depressed, but nothing that bad.

My parents were getting divorced, my baby brother was facing jail time, I was under crazy pressure at school. I was unhappy in my relationship and I had absolutely no money. I was abusing weed and alcohol to deal with everything and if I was totally numb to the world I was having a good day. I got sloppy with birth control at that time, I just didn’t have any space in my head to worry about it. I ended up getting accidentally pregnant and I had an abortion. The day of the doctor’s visit I went to the clinic with my boyfriend where we were physically and verbally assaulted by protesters. I was called horrible things. They surrounded me with huge posters of images of aborted fetal tissue. At the office, they forced me to have an ultrasound and look at the fetus. Even after I took the pills I couldn’t afford the days off work, so I went to my job, went to classes, did everything while I was bleeding so intensely I had to change my pad every half hour. The pain was the worst I have ever felt. I vomited for days. And when it was all over, I had to face the concept that I had murdered my baby. I no longer believe that that’s what I did- but I was raised religious and conservative and the shame runs deep. Anyway I was so ashamed and humiliated and felt so guilty, like I was a literal murderer who deserved to die. I could never tell anyone what had happened. Still, no one but me and my bf know. It’s a secret that I have carried for almost two years now and not one day passes where I don’t feel a wave of nausea and panic when I remember what I did. I told myself when it happened that if I ever got pregnant again I would just kill myself rather than deal with everything I dealt with again. 


My period is late now by a couple of days. Every day it doesn’t come I get more and more terrified that I might be pregnant. Tomorrow I’m going to buy a pregnancy test and if it’s positive I have a really hard decision to make. I’m a days drive away from an abortion provider and I don’t have a car. I will have to tell my mother I’m pregnant, and she will disown me. It would be better for her if I committed suicide rather than have an abortion or a child outside of marriage.

So let's make this post an official time capsule for all the random shit that we probably won't remember when we have mortgages and insurmountable debt so that we can always look back our most memorable moments.

I'll go first:

One time, when I was in middle school, a friend and I were walking around our neighborhood to see if any of our other friends wanted to play at a nearby park. As we're walking, I notice one of  my neighbors walking her dog. Now, I'm no dog whisperer but I was convinced this dog was chasing slaves in a past life. At this point in time, I was one of few black kids in my neighborhood, and this dog only tried to jump at/bark at me instead of anyone else. Every time this dog would go off at me, and my neighbor would look at me as if it were my fault, so I just started switching to the other side of the street when I saw her walking the dog.

This time though, the dog was particularly irritated. After seeing me, the dog was mad but that anger only elevated when it saw another dog walker coming up the street. Still standing on my friend's doorstep, it was like I could see the cogs turning in the dog's head, like it was trying to figure out how to wreak the most havoc. The demon-dog immediately starts jumping at the other dog and the nice dog walker lets go of the leash and now Doggy Diablo is just chasing the other dog around. Unfortunately, the first dog walker wasn't so sharp and holds onto her dog's leash the whole time as she gets dragged around on the street. After what felt like the longest 30 seconds of my life, both dogs calmed down and went their separate ways. The first dog walker's clothes were a little roughed up but I think she was fine, even if she lost a little bit of pride that day.

My friend couldn't go with us to the park but we were all lucky enough to witness a Looney Tunes-esque moment that would stay with us for a while.

TL;DR I asked my friend if he could play at the park. He said no.",non-suicide

204843,"after reaching out to talk, i only feel guilt for the way i feel.Idk what’s been going on with me lately but it’s scary...there’s days when i’m completely optimistic and nothing can bring me down and then I eventually fall back into my old bad habits. It doesn’t help that I’m having to be quarantined at my parents house as I’m 24 now and my relationship with my parents is completely strained. Me and my boyfriend fight almost every day and at this point I have no friends left except coworkers that I don’t want to know too much about me. I’m so distant because of my depression. When I speak to my boyfriend about how I feel he normally gets mad at me or just doesn’t say anything and sits on the phone obviously texting as I’m crying my eyes out or having an anxiety attack. If i don’t respond to something he says as I’m having a full blown anxiety attack and can barely breathe correctly he gets mad at me and hangs up on me. It’s a full indicator that I’m wasting his time...and a reminder that anytime I try to come to someone for help it’s nothing but a waste of everyone’s time and even my own because I’m just left feeling more guilty. 

I tried reaching out to my cousin but I felt guilty about it and stopped myself from getting further into detail about how I feel. I just feel so worthless and emotionally weak.

It’s hard feeling comfortable with my emotions and moving forward when the only person I have to talk to tells me that I feel the way I feel because I want attention or feels personally attacked for the way that I feel when all I want is comfort.

204845,"Made a promise I don't want to keepI'll start out by saying I know this is ridiculous.

About a month ago, I was in a really bad place. I was struggling with the end of the last quarter at school, I was doing a lot of negative self-talk I was having urges to hurt myself after years and years of not having any of those thoughts. I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night. I was hitting myself sometimes.

I had been late to work, almost always because of the stupid bus system. They're transferring me up to where I live now, but at the time I took it really hard when they pulled me aside and had to tell me I would lose my job if I was late again. If I lose this job, I lose my insurance, I lose any hope of a future where I can have some medical work I need done. I made a promise to myself to kill myself if I was late to work again. Don't show up at all, just, if I know I'll be late, go straight to my planned bridge. I knew I would keep it if it happened.

But I didn't want to kill myself. I decided to just be extra-extra early every day.

On Sunday, I was 3 minutes late. The first bus of the morning was 5 minutes late, the bus driver took forever, and was held up in the tunnel. I had to beg the bus driver to let me off, and I ran 15 blocks to work only to be late.

I felt so guilty for being late, because I knew what I had promised myself. I don't want to die. I've met someone that makes me really happy. Things have been getting better. But now I have this stupid promise hanging over me, and I can't let it go.

I guess I'm just ranting, I don't know where else to talk about it. Gah.",suicide

I feel like I've faked my way through everything, and when I do try to seriously put effort in, I end up spinning my wheels and often failing worse. I'm currently going to a very expensive college, and I feel like I don't deserve to be there. I don't feel smart enough or capable enough, and I've been really struggling since I got here, and I'm in my senior year now and nothing is better and I can't do anything and none of my professors believe in me anymore and they all look at me like they don't want me to be there or like I'm an annoyance. They treat me as if I'm unreliable, which makes me panic and spiral and then I AM unreliable and I make everything worse. I feel like all the negative things people say about me are true. I feel like I can't do anything right. I've tried really hard to get better, but nothing ever sticks. I've been in therapy and taken medications and gotten an ADHD coach and I still can't do anything for myself.

I know failing isn't horrible, but it proved to me that I haven't improved at all and that I am totally and completely hopeless. I failed the same class twice after the professors bent over backwards to help me and the class wasn't even difficult to begin with. If I fail again I'm going to be kicked out, and I feel so guilty that my parents have wasted money on my education and trying to get me help when I'm just a helpless idiot who can't do anything. I know people let care about me, and I know it will hurt them, but I don't know how I'm going to ever be able to function on my own and I don't want my parents or friends to waste any more time or money or effort on me when everything up until this point hasn't worked. I just feel so guilty and I hate myself for messing up so badly when all my parents have done is support me and try to give me the opportunity to succeed. I wish I could just flip a switch and have it all be over, but I know that if I tried to kill myself I'd just fuck that up too and then make even more problems for my family and cost them even more money.

well firstly, it hasn't even shown signs of ""getting better"" and i'm sick of hearing that. if you're going to promise something like that, all it does is get my hopes up for something that never occurs.

secondly, different meds; i've been on several and none seem to alleviate this desire to just end it all. when they stop taking away the desire to do it, it just leaves the thoughts of how i'd do it. so suicidal thoughts without wanting to die. its weird.

thirdly; ""stop overreacting"". what? seriously? this one is my mum. someone who has dealt with mental illness herself. she keeps on brushing it off like i WANT to feel this way or that i'm doing it for some attention. i am bringing my fears to her and asking for help and sure she might not like seeing her son this way but demeaning the feelings with something like that only makes things worse and feel more lonely. and that adds onto the final point of ""you don't really want to"". why am i being told how my brain works? this isn't a new occurrence. it is constant. i am trying to tell you how i feel but you're telling me ""oh but you don't feel that way"". well there we go, i'm cured because you said i don't feel that way.

i know this seems more like a rant than some form of watching out for suicide, but its this shit that keeps bringing my closer and closer and closer to taking the plunge and doing it. i am so god damn lonely, distressed, completely empty feeling inside and feel ill all the time whether i'm dizzy, sick or something else, it feels so inescapable that death feels like such a freeing idea.

I am exhausted from questioning everything and constantly blaming myself. I am exhausted from wanting consistently wanting to die (even if it's not every second, there's only been a few days I can think of where I didn't think of suicide).

I did speak out about one person who sexually abused me and continued to hurt me after my relationship with them. It became news, and due to reasons I cannot specify for anonymity, I was silenced because of their money/power. I was labeled a ""false accuser"". I cannot get work, I cannot leave the house without panic attacks as a result of everything, I have no joy and no reason to continue.

Ill try to make this as short as i can. I came to Reddit because i have no one else to talk to. Sorry if its long, I've lost pretty much all my good friends and my best friend well..

So my ex and I were dating for 3 years. I loved her and im pretty sure she loved me for most of it. Im 19 now and she was the first girlfriend ive had. She couldnt count how many guys she had been with if she had four hands but I didnt care, I really liked her. My friends and pretty much everyone i knew judged her and myself when we started dating (back in senior year of high school right) but i didnt care. I usually would but to me she was more important than all of them. We were both jealous but she only had guy friends, but i didnt mind that, i trusted her. Over the course of 2 years we were seeing eachother all the time, i had stopped seeing all my other friends, stopped doing sports and working out, cancelled any plans so i could spend time with her. She also pretty much made me get rid of any girl Friend i would rarely talk to. But she would consistently go out with her guy friends (forgot to mention she gets REALLLLL close when shes a little tipsy)  At this point she wanted me to stop smoking marijuana. I believe she really just wanted to help me but she wasnt very supportive about it. She ended up seeing her ex (who is ironically a drug dealer) after i had tried a few times but ended up smoking and lying, which i shouldnt have lied,  and i didnt know what to do. Time passes, we end up getting back together and of course by this time our relationship isnt the same as it was the first months we met. She didnt like that although i was not the best boyfriend during this whole time, a lot of accumulation of little things (and big) that i totally understand was not cool.
My best friend and I start seeing each other more and my ex would throw small parties at her place and we'd all be there. They became really close (a lot more than i found appropriate ex.. she had sit on his lap like she would sit on me which i found really disturbing, and the worst part, I SAID NOTHING!) So i have family in the US that i hadnt seen in a while and i end up taking a week off to go visit them. I tell my 2 friends and they start talking about how theyre going to get together like that whole week and go to festivals and have fun (which she never really proposed to me). This kinda bothered me the way theyd talk about it but i said nothing and didnt think about it. The day before i leave my ex and i were both working and i asked her if she wanted to see me. She said she had plans, i ask her whats up she says shes going to drink with my best buddy. I find it a little weird how they hadnt said anything to me and i jokingly ask what time were leaving and she really sent off this vibe that she didnt want me coming but acted as if it was okay. We all drink have a good time, i leave the next day.
The first 2-1/2 days she didnt talk to me so i end up messaging her, blablabla shes seeing my buddy, theyre going to drink, ok. The next day i get a text from my buddy saying how they fell asleep together (only sleep) and how he feels really bad blablabla, i flip and dont talk to my ex for the rest of the trip (took her a while to even message me that day). I get back and simply put we end up getting together again,i pretty much dumped my best friend but she keeps talking to him... A few weeks pass and i check her phone while shes asleep and i find out she had been fucking sleeping with him while we were ''together'' and that first time too. I flip the fuck out, and long story short i end up sleeping with another girl in the span of a week. I regret everything. I knew that i still loved her and i could have said no but i didnt. And i hate myself everyday for that. Now shes seeing my buddy again and i feel like shes manipulating me with this messages bbut than she'll send me some video and expects a nice reply.. idk Im to a point where i wake up in the morning and dont want to get up. I dont want to do anything because i feel like its all useless. And when i say that i am 100% convinced that everything is useless and i dont know why im doing anything really.. if that makes sense ahah
I smoke more than ever now and i cant remember the last day ive gone sober. I hate waking up everyday, i have no real talents ambition or motivation to do anything and every day passes and im wondering why im still going.. But im scared of not knowing whats after death, only reason im still here (ive been suicidal long before ive met my ex). Now shes seeing my best bud again sending me snaps of them and ignoring my calls and really doesnt give a shit about me, which i understand.. i just dont know where im going after this.
Sorry if this was all over the place, i tried to summarize and i was onn the top of my head really.. i just dont know what to do.. please dont tell me its only my first girlfriend or anything, ive experienced some stuff as a kid and feeling the same feeling of being abandoned once again, i know its something i never want to feel again. At the start of everything i had told her about what happened and that i had trouble getting emotionally attached to someone and she in a sense forced the relationship..

204930,"Why can’t I just be happy?First time here, no idea whether I’m on the right sub. I just feel so confused and would like some help.

I have struggled with my mental health for some time now. A year ago I started having suicidal thoughts but I fought them off pretty quickly. Within the last 6 months I’ve really gotten better, I’m feeling so much more like myself before all this.
But the last couple of weeks I have been struggling. I haven’t been able to come to work and when I do, I fuck up regular stuff that I normally do with ease. It’s been so fucking scary.

This past weekend I was a part of something. I volunteered at a political event that I agree with so wholeheartedly and I felt like I was a part of something good. I can’t really describe it. I just never been REALLY a part of something like that. The few friends I have refer to me as the person who is only sometimes there. I don’t get as many invites as the others in the group. I’m always last choice.

Anyway at the event I met this group of insanely funny people and they invited me over to their party. It was probably the best night in my life. It was a big group and EVERYONE welcomed me. We talked all night, it was so intense and intimate. I felt so welcomed and preferred (does that even make sense?) that I can’t even begin to describe it.

On my way home I couldn’t stop shaking the feeling that given my earlier experiences, this would probably be the only time in my life that I would feel this good. I cried so much and my suicidal thoughts began again. Will I ever be happy? Why can I only have this once? And why couldn’t I just have enjoyed it and thought back to it with bliss? Now I can’t think about it, because it just reminds me of what little of that I have in my life.

I just don’t want to feel anymore. And even though I don’t want to die, I can’t think of any other way to make these feelings go away. They’re just too much to bear.",suicide

Living with an irrationally angered father is beyond my ability to cope. He imposes too many restrictions (Despite the fact that I'm over 18), verbally abuses my little brother and I, and he doesn't get his priorities straight. Over a year ago, when we moved out from my stepmother's house due to relationship issues, he decided to rent an apartment and so we moved there. We didn't have furniture, so we bought a kitchen table that came with chairs, and a set of couches. a few months later, I told him my brother and I needed beds, the twin sized ones, I never asked for a California king or anything bigger that the twin sized ones. I want anyone who's reading this to guess what he bought instead, AIR MATTRESSES! And not even 2 month's later, they already have holes on them! A fucking smart way to spend his money. I kept telling him that we need beds, BEDS! Real mattresses! and it's been over a fucking year living in this apartment and we're still sleeping over deflated air mattresses because he was too busy buying everything else, including a 55"" 4k TV that costed him enough money to buy two beds but no! He has control over his money and me after all. I told him he should've bought a bed first and yep, you guessed it, he got triggered! Up to this day, I've been sleeping on the floor uncomfortably and I can't sleep straight at night, but if someone would ask me ""Would you rather sleep on the floor every night and wake up every 2 hours? or put yourself to sleep permanently?"" I'd say It's about time I get myself a long goodnight sleep at this point. Simply reasoning with a father like him is futile. I told him many times that he could've bought beds first and everything else can wait, but no. He just threatened to kick me out instead. The only way out, like I said, is by putting myself in a deathbed. It's not that I will do it out of depression or anything of the like, it's about sending a message to him that will remind him of how much he has damaged me over the past few years, and that message will stay with him forever, should I choose to end it. Right now, I am looking for a reason to not to, but perhaps another way to end this all peacefully would be better.",suicide

I am still utterly heartbroken and disillusioned. My close friends have all moved away to college while I was rejected from my wanted school and forced to stay here in my hometown. I can't get a job and am stuck at home with my alcoholic depressed parents for the next year at least. 

I am completely and utterly alone. 

I was depending solely on making friends in college clubs but now it's all online and clubs are cancelled. I can't hold up the slightest shred of optimism anymore. I genuinely do not know what to do.

I'm seriously considering killing myself. I know that things 'will get better in the future' or whatever bs but I don't think I can hold on long enough to see that. I try to get up and be positive and exercise and everything but by the end of the day I'm worn down and disappointed and cry all night. I've done nothing wrong to anyone but the universe is laughing at me and throwing down more and more shit. I promised myself 6 months ago things would improve and they've only gotten worse. 

I keep seeing stories of people partying or moving into their dorms or with their s/o making the most of this last year and its like salt to wound. If I couldn't have love or my course, at the very very least I just wanted to have friends. I tried to reconnect with some people but it's like I'm broken or something.

I’ve stopped caring about how people will care when I’m dead, sure they’ll be sad, Theyll mourn, they’ll cry, they’ll probably even end up with a internal dialog worse then mine, but they’ll get better. They’ve been through worse, and they’ll continue going through worse and worse things. Why’d I be different? I mean sure, I’m friends with people, I’m the first son, I’m the guy people can turn to and just let shit out and I’m the guy who’ll do everything in his power to try to fix it. But I can’t keep going feeling like I’m doing everything wrong, I can’t keep going thinking I’m letting my gf down, I can’t keep going counting the days before she starts doing shit with other people - thinking about ending it with me, I can’t deal with the heartbreak I’d feel knowing this is the happiest I’ll feel with someone and have them step on me. Do I deserve it? Sure. But do I want it? Hell no. Would I be surprised? Not even alittle. Recently I’ve been wanting to drink, I want that kick of something strong and not remember the night beforehand. I don’t want to remember half the shit that I do. Is it selfish? hell yeah. Most of what my moms told me is the reason I’m turning to a bunch of people reading through reddit at 2300 when they have a exam in the morning. (Go tf to sleep, god knows I want to.) I’m only here because I keep going back and forth on whether I want to take people with me or just goto sleep. I wish someone could hold me and make it better, but I know that’s not how that works way to well. Eating’s getting scarce, no appetite anymore. Schools suffering, (teacher deadass told me to give up xd) my motivation is gone, I don’t enjoy anything I do anymore, and I feel like I’m far too gone. Been feeling that way sense 6th grade. Uhhhhhh other then that, I just want to do enough shit that I can’t feel anything anymore. Thank you for reading, I’ll update as needed. Those of you feeling the same way, don’t follow my example, you have people who love you. I love you. Gimme a smooch 😘

I never wanted to die, I wanted the opposite. I wanted to live forever. To me there was never a point to life unless I could live forever. Why bother if you're going to die anyway? This thought just kept repeating in my mind ""You're going to die. You're going to die. Could be tomorrow, could be today, death is waiting for you."" It just made me long for it. Just get it over with, please, make it quick. 

You people have helped me realise that perhaps all's not lost. If I write my book then perhaps I can create something of a lasting legacy. The book I'm writing is mostly about my mind, about my beliefs and about my struggle. I've warped these themes into a story and I hope I can finish it one of these days. 

Perhaps if the legacy of my conscience and my mind can live on long after I decay, then I can be immortal. All my life, I just wished I could be the last human being on earth, living long after the last human dies. It is the ultimate comfort for me, that thought. I've had this wish since a very early age. It's nothing of a God-complex. It's just knowing that human life has been concluded. That everyone has had their spill at life and some have had fun. I want to be there to see it end. 

Anyway, you guys helped me towards achieving a fraction of that dream. I hope that if a publisher likes it enough to publish it, the bookworms among you will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it. I will definitely update should that be the case. 

In any case, thanks for listening and thanks for doing what you're doing.

The other two are best friends and one of them told me I make her depression worse when I turn to her for help. I can’t talk to anyone, I have no one. I’ve never even fucking held a guys hand in all my fucking life. I don’t know I’m just kind of rambling. I just don’t know what to do. I’m so lonely, I don’t feel like I have a home. I’ve tried dating a couple of times but I guess I just get too up in my own head. I just want someone to hold me while I cry. I want my old friends back from before I came out. I just feel like my life is going no where and everyone around me seems to be burdened by me. The only reason I haven’t killed myself is because my best friend, the one who isn’t talking to me, her dad committed suicide. I could never make her go through that again. I just don’t know where to go or what to do to make life bearable.

I have a counselor through my school and I really like him. The sessions feel helpful while I’m there but by the end of the week I feel like killing myself again. I’m just lost. I don’t see a reason. I don’t know how to find a purpose. It all feels pointless. I’m sorry I don’t mean to bother anyone. Ugh I just feel like fucking exploding. I’m sorry I know some people don’t like swear words. Ugh

I have my boyfriend in my ear telling me to get an abortion while in the other ear is my entire family saying ""don't kill my niece/nephew/grandchild"".

I'm in no place to have a child. I have lots of supports that would help me if I chose to keep the baby, but I just graduated with my bachelor's and have yet to find a job (I do have a promising interview next week though). 

With the stress of everything I've felt literally mentally insane. I've been hearing voices and seeing things which I attribute to my very high stress levels and lack of sleep. I need help because obviously I cannot die right now, it isnt just me anymore. But I've been feeling like a danger to myself. I have access to perscriptions (240 benzos and ambien).

205072,"I don't know where to turn anymore.For background: I'm a young teenage girl that goes to a Catholic school against her will \[family isn't Catholic\]

Basically, I need advice.

When I was little, I'd always get angry at people and tell them I'd break their nose or, in one case, I really hated this kid Kaden, and on a list of things to ""annoy"" him, I wrote I'd eat his flesh. I always got sent to the office for behavior issues and was put in some special classes because of it too. I got pulled out of school by my parents because the school wanted to put me on medication. \[My mom believes they wanted to induct me in some religion or some crap, she believes a bunch of insane crazy shit so I guess I'm not surprised.. More on her later.\]

Around 9 years later, I'm in a Catholic school. It was okay at first, but It's only gotten worse. Now I'm at the lowest point in my life. Whenever I run to my parents, they always call me selfish and/or spoiled for feeling alone. I'm an extrovert and I only want to be with people and make them happy but it's almost impossible for me now. I have these HORRIBLE mood swings that used to be alright, but now interfere with my life. I can go from being extremely happy to extremely angry. Usually it's from something to anger. Whenever I get into one of these anger episodes, I usually cry a ton, throw things, and say pretty violent things about whatever angered me, even if it was a computer.

This is all involuntary and I can't control it-and now it's taking over my life. Often when I'm doing the dishes I look at the knives and I wonder what it'd be like if I killed myself, but I never do it because I'm scared. Then I just shake my head and go back to my chore.

I know my life is far from horrible, and I feel GUILTY for feeling like this. I know other kids would be overjoyed to have a life like mine but... I can't help but to cry over the smallest things. I know this isn't like the other girls in my class. I really want to go to a psychiatrist but my parents won't let me. The only time I've been happy in the past month was visiting my brother in L.A. for a few days \[I absolutely LOVE my brother. He's one of the only things that I couldn't live without\] but after that, I came home to Minnesota and had a complete culture shock. Going to school after that just threw me off the edge and I haven't been able to handle myself since. I know something's always been wrong but I guess I won't be able to know for a while.

I've been experiencing the mood swings and sadness for the past 3 years now and it's only gotten worse. Can't get through the day without a swing interrupting me and making me lose my shit in the middle of class or something like that.

Anyways, I could use advice. I have nowhere else to turn except here, I'm kind of lonely. I've reached out for help so many times but I've gotten little to none. I'm so over my fucking life at this point that I feel like hell's just repeating itself every day. I've woken up at 2PM for the past 3 days, I sleep in the attic and it's hot as hell up here, just-- everything at once builds up and becomes a living nightmare. Again, I know I sound ungrateful but I literally cannot help it.

I can't really convey the situation perfectly over text, but I hope someone out there understands.",suicide

Life isn't what I planned, it's not bad, but it is depressingly lonely. Knowing I'll be that ""old"" it causing a lot of emotions...I feel like i've wasted my youth and I've lost the chance to have meaningful friendships in my life.   


I should feel positive. I have a fantastic job, I'm the youngest teacher at a local college, I teach a subject that interests me and I get paid to talk about it. That should be enough, but no. I still feel like I have zero idea what I want from life, I kind of just fell into this job...I don't think I deserve it. Majority of my coworkers are the same age as my mom, so it's awkward to be social with them.  


Maybe this is heightened because a friend of the family just OD'd two days ago and the thought of death is rapidly in my brain?  


I used to go to dance and gymanstics everyday, I miss it. i miss my healthy body from it. Everyone else just seemed to make friends so easily while I was always on the sideline. I miss dance. I wish I had made friends as easily as everyone else did. 

I call my grandpa &amp; grandma at least once a day, gives me someone to talk to. I don't bother with my mom, she loves me but she rarely has the time for me. I try calling her but she doesn't usually answer, she has her own life so that's fair enough. I'm not close with my sister, it's hard to be when I'm 27 and she just turned 13...I can only really talk to her on a superficial level. I have a boyfriend and he is amazing but I still feel incredibly lonely. I think they feel sad for me, they know that I'm lonely and I think they realize that I actually don't have friends. I had a friend, but we were both honestly toxic for each other so we don't talk anymore...probably for the best but I still miss our friendship.   


I asked myself to think of reasons not to kill myself. I'm not skinny enough to die. I have my pet skinny pig and even though he rarely shows any love he'd starve without me. My family would be a wreck, it wouldn't be fair to them. I don't live alone and with social distancing it would be a lot of effort. I'm scared of what is on the other side. Because you can't listen to Hamilton or watch Bojack if you are dead. You can't start dancing again if you are dead. You can't write if you are dead. You can not video chat your loving niece if you are dead. You have no legacy if you die now. You've never seen Star Wars Land at Disneyland yet. Your mom would never forgive you. you won't get to cook again. You won't get to perform again.   


Breathe. Take a breathe. I can't cry because I'm actually on video as I write all this down, my class is doing some assignments and little do they realize I am writing about why i shouldn't kill myself but want to.   
I keep saying things will be okay, I keep trying to make things okay, I keep trying to add new lights into my life...but when will everything just be okay? stop. stop focusing on the negative. breathe. in. out. in. out.   


now I need to go back to teaching my class, pretend none of these feelings are here. but the important thing is, I am safe, as much as i want to harm myself i know that writing this helped. I feel less anxious, I feel like I can focus on those reasons to not kill myself. It's a start.",suicide

205083,"The discussion of false rape accusation on this sub is weird (repost cause apparently I'm not allowed to say the word for reddit's version of likes) So recently, there's been a post going around showing a poster in India stating

&gt;False rape accusations are punishableThe law exists for your protectionnot for settling scores

The post wasn't hugely popular, but most of the comments on this were positive and in favor of the rule, and I just wanted to say how fucking stupid that is.

Like okay, being falsely accused of rape is incredibly shitty and can damage a man's reputation and even ruin his life in some cases. But what people on this sub don't seem to understand is that those are incredibly rare. A simple google search are you'll get a ton of sources saying around the same number, 2%-10% of rape allegations have been proven to be false. Of course, those are only the proven false ones, and its impossible to know the real numbers. But, even if a much greater number of rape allegations are false, they rarely ruin a man's life. You may here horror stories about how one woman was able to completely destroy someone just by saying a few things, even if he got acquitted, and while I'm not denying these exist, but they're are in the vast minority. You can see many men in high positions of power who have been accused of sexual harassment, yet retain their positions. Meanwhile, it's estimated that about 63% of sexual assaults go unreported.

This law in India only protects offenders and makes it harder for woman to come out against them. If you really want laws punishing people spreading lies about you, we already have them, their called libel and slander. We don't punish people for falsely accusing someone of stealing or murder, unless of course they have actively defame those accused.

I'm probably not the best person to talk about this since I'm a guy, and a lot of people may go out of their way to call me a simp, but I just wanted to point out how unreasonably skewed the discussion about these topics are on this sub.

Edit: people seemed to be confused as to what I'm trying to say, and that's fair, I might not have said it as clearly as I could have so here goes: I'm not saying there shouldn't be proof or that proven false accusations should go unpunished, obviously they should, but this is covered in our current legal system (innocent until proven guilty, laws against slander and libel). What I'm saying, or at least trying to, is that the conversation about these topics on this sub is vastly skewed, and signs like these in India, actively dissuade people from coming forward",non-suicide

205096,"At 22 I think I’ve actually yanked my life.When I was about 19/20, I started to turn my life back around from the fucked up mess I had made it. I was living with my girlfriend at the time. I got health insurance, I quit smoking cigarettes &amp; I registered for my first college classes &amp; everything seemed to be going good. The semester was about to start and for the first time in so long I felt motivation, I felt a drive to do good for myself. I was realizing that I’ve almost never had this drive before. Classes had been going on for a few weeks and I LOVED it. I was enjoying class and getting my assignments done when I would get home from school, which all throughout 6-12th grade wasn’t a thing. Then my gf at the time and I broke up. It destroyed me, a few weeks had gone by and I felt myself dragging myself to class and starting to lose momentum. One night I finally decided to call it quits. I had gotten prescribed syraquil a while back before starting classes for my depression, anxiety and insomnia. Which was helping with my sleep but my mood swings would go completely out of wack. It was struggle to keep a steady mood. I had gotten a handful of my syraquil, a couple Xanax from a friend &amp; a Kalatapin from a friends mom. Put them in my pocket and sort of had them there for the time. Before this day I had never done pills before in my life. They’ve never turned me on &amp; I was drug free until this day. I drove to my closest friends house to spend some time with him and try to vent my emotions out. What it did was spiral myself deeper into a hole I never thought I could dig down to. I took all the pills I could take at once and chased them down with about 4 bud lights. I sit outside of my friends house and pour myself my own thoughts of final goodbyes and regrets. I get into my car and have no final destination in mind and I just drive. I feel myself lose consciousness and all I remember is a guardrail that I see half way through my in and out consciousness.  I almost hit but correct myself. Moments later I wake up in a bed. My first reaction is utter fear. I don’t have recollection of where I was or how I get there. So I run. I rip out IVs and rip off monitors and head for the first door I see. I don’t make it far until an alarm springs from the monitored bed and a nurse stops me at the door. I was alone and had no one in my room. I thought this was it, I thought I actually made it and was awaiting my judgment. But at the same time I thought there was no one there to care if I died or made out alive. My mind was moving a thousand miles a second. My mom and best friend race in to see that I accruals woke up. They did not pump, they did nothing but monitor and keep myself under strict supervision. My heart slowed to extreme levels but that was it. I had come to realize. I’m unfazed and feel as if nothing had even happened. I woke up like any other day has went by. I’m upset but relieved. I’m happy but disappointed. Ive yet to get myself to get down that deep again. But at times I try just so I can build the courage to do it. Every night when I go to sleep I just wish with everything that I have. That it would’ve just worked. My family and friends would be without griefs. I’d be just a memory at this point. At this moment right now I’m just hoping for an accident to come my way because I’m too big of a pussy to try and end my own life. I wish I didn’t feel like such a constant disappointment, a let down, and a wasted life. I don’t feel as if I’m able to feel loved. I don’t think I’ve ever felt loved. I don’t know any other way of putting it. My grandma is the only person that I’ve ever think I’ve come close to feeling loved. I’m sure this doesn’t get read over as the average person tends to not have the time for all of this. I just feel like I’ve done what I could with my life and I’m ready to check out.

205097,"I feel like Stan from South Park.I'm not a good writer or story teller so bare with me. If any of you have seen the South Park episode where Stan only sees and hears things as shit then you'll know how I feel.

I've been depressed for the past 8 years of my life. I used to enjoy doing activities even if overall I still felt like shit. I guess at some point I have become immune to feeling. This has made everything, including the activities I used to enjoy, turn into shit for me. I used to enjoy learning, I used to have a lot of fun hanging out with friends, I used to love playing sports, I used to play video games every day like they were crack because I enjoyed playing them and challenging myself and testing myself against others. Now I don't want to do any of that, I spend probably 16 hours of each day laying in my bed. It's been getting harder and harder for me to even get out of bed, and there have been plenty of times where I just didn't. I'm so fucking tired of feeling nothing. It is honestly worse than feeling sad all the time. I think the best way to explain it is even when I was constantly sad there were a few fleeting moments where I could feel happy. Now there is just nothing, it's like I forgot how to human. I feel so fucked up in the head at this point I've questioned every relationship I've ever had and if it was genuine or not. It doesn't help I don't have any friends anymore. Everytime I made a friend or best friend they would either stop talking to me, or would just disappear causing me to be alone again trying to find new friends. Every time I began talking to a girl they would suddenly lose interest like I was boring. I've only had one meaningful relationship and even then it felt like she never truly trusted me. It has broken me down to the point where I don't even try anymore. I've shut down anyone who tries to talk to me and have kept every conversation in the past 2 years at a very superficial level. I'm now in college, failing, without a single friend. All I ask myself everyday is what is the point. Can someone tell me, what is the point in doing something anymore if you get 0 enjoyment from it?  It doesn't feel worth it anymore. I don't see a light at the end of a tunnel.

205112,"Boy do I have a story to tell y'all Ok, so my mom thought that I didn't have a lot of friends bc of the pandemic so she signed me up for this random zoom class for teens to talk to each other. The ''teacher'' of the class is a school therapist so she initiates the conversation in the beginning and keeps track of time. 

The first class was today. I join the zoom and see that there are only 4 other students in the class. I don't remember their names so I'll try to describe them. There was a Tan boy, an African American boy, a Caucasian girl with a bob, and a Caucasian girl with a pixie cut and blue tips. 

So the hangout starts and we talk about random things, everyone asks me a lot of questions since I'm new but I don't mind the attention :) I appreciate a lot that they included me bc usually when I join a new class they all go and talk about inside jokes and are super clicky. 

About 15 minutes into the call the teacher says to tan boy ''do you want to take your 5 minutes?''. She explains to me that tan boy really really likes trains so they give tan boy 5 minutes to talk about trains since he doesn't like to talk about anything else. I underestimated how much tan boy likes trains bc he starts streaming himself playing a train game while talking about trains and playing train sounds. We all listen for 5 minutes until the teacher says that his time has passed. he stays for 15 more minutes in the call silently then leaves. The only time he talked was about the trains during his 5 minutes. When he leaves girl with a bob explains to me that they had to limit his train talk to 5 minutes bc before they did he would go on and on about trains for the full hour and no one else could talk about anything else. 

Then the teacher asks African American boy if he wants to play a song for us today, he says yes. He's already at his keyboard and he plays an upbeat discoy song. He had changed some of the keys on his keyboard to play little catchphrases instead of notes so it sounded like a DJ. 

I could tell that girl with a bob had a few social issues but that doesn't matter. she was really sweet and outgoing :)

We keep chatting about random things and I talk to blue pixie cut girl a lot. She likes the same music as me and I think her personality is really neat. I've been looking for some friends that are girls because I'm a girl and all my friends are guys so I thought it would be nice to have someone to relate to. 

The teacher leaves the call because it's been an hour but me and African American boy and blue pixie cut girl stay in the call to chat. African American boy plays music in the background while I and blue pixie cut girl talk. She makes a comment that she's shy because she gets shy talking to pretty girls. I'm like aww thank you :). Then she says that she's gay and asks me if I am. I say thank you but I'm straight. Weirdly this isn't the first time a girl has hit on me and asked me if I was gay lol. Then she asks me if I want to hear the song she wrote and I say yes. It was a romantic song and she replaced the name in the song with my name 😳I'm thinking to myself dang she's really putting on the moves for me XD

Overall I had a really good time. I could really relate to almost all the teens in the class in some way. The teacher brought up the topic of anxiety which is something I deal with and it turns out all of them do too. The group was so charming in a socially dysfunctional way :) They have planned a virtual prom and I'm very excited about it!

205115,"I can barely even write thisSorry this is so long - just skim and you'll get the idea. 

Things have gotten so painful I don't even know how to have the energy to write this. 

Basically, I feel like my life is a joke. 

I had a traumatic/abusive childhood. I watched my mom abuse my dad my whole childhood. I watched him go blind (not related to the abuse). My parents were, of course, abusive to me. 

After being guilted to letting my mom homeschool me in 6th grade, I returned to public school having plucked off half of my right eyebrow (thanks OCD/related problems). The kids made fun of me and said I was ugly. I was ugly, though. 

Now I'm 26, and have my full eyebrow, but I still feel hideous.  I used to be able to wear contacts. They made me feel more confident. Then I got dry eye syndrome at 19. No more contacts. I'm petite so glasses look like shit on my face. 


I've been in a relationship for several years with a guy who I love, but I do not feel he loves me.  He says he does, and I want to believe him, but I'm becoming more aware of the dynamics that have existed between us and still do, and feel confused. I have definitely contributed to the problem with my neediness and anxious attachment style, but I feel our dynamics brought out the absolute worst of my trauma issues. I have been in 3 long-term relationships. None of them were perfect, but I never lost my shit nearly as much as I have In these past several years.  

At first things seemed like there was no way it could go wrong. It ended up that we had opposite attachment styles. As soon as I was fully in his life, he started distancing himself. I cried because I wanted to hang out, and he ignored me for his computer. He started being easily irritated. Even if I tried my best to not irritate him, he'd get irritated at me and kinda talk down to me. 

I had problems having sex. It hurt and I have pelvic floor dysfunction. I had sex with him, and started getting UTIs. Thanks to my many childhood traumas (Complex PTSD), I just crumbled under the pressure of my chronic UTIs and my partners anger. I basically begged him to love me and be there for me. He was always so upset at me for wanting his support. I stupidly kept begging him to skype with me (we were long distance part of the time), talk with me, etc. He distanced himself further. 

More sex, more UTIs. Long story short, it turned into Interstitial Cystitis. This was in 2014. I still have this condition to this day. It feels like a UTI that never goes away. I had to stop working because the pain was too severe.  I used the opportunity to focus on healing my trauma, and sought psychotherapy. I also did a year of DBT and have read enough self help book content to write one of my own. All of this while mostly long distance. I wanted to Skype with him and talk, but when we Skype he usually just browsed the internet and ignored me. If I tried to talk to him or ask why we couldn't talk, it'd just turn into an argument about me being bad in some way. I'd walk away feeling hurt, lonely, ashamed, and confused. 

I moved in with him. He was angry at me for not cleaning enough and unpacking the boxes within 2 weeks of me moving in with him. I was emotionally and physically exhausted from the move. I legitimately had to lay down and felt so much pain. He pointed his finger and angrily told me I am just ""not doing anything"" while he works so hard at his job. I tried to explain I am really trying my best, and am sick and still learning how to do things. 

Before I moved here, I had been living with my parents. During trauma therapy, my CPTSD and physical pain got so bad that I was hiding out in my room most of the time. I tried my best to take care of myself, going to psychotherapy, pelvic floor therapy, numerous doctor appointments, taking supplements, trying meds...

I was trying so hard, and reaching out to talk to my partner as he angrily pushed me away. I was definitely out of line sometimes, expecting too much from him. I behaved like a terrified child, begging her father to love her and spend time with her. But the premise upon which we started this relationship was that he would take care of me and I would do whatever he said (yes, I now realize that is unhealthy). He even said I was his ""little girl."" 

How we got from there to me so sick, and him so relentlessly disappointed and distant, I don't fully understand. 

This condition took everything from me. With IC, I can't have sex without severe pain. I can't eat tomatoes, most fruits, anything with vinegar/soy, no alcohol or coffee...and I can't have cheese and am supposed to not eat chocolate (I eat it anyway because fuck that -- that'd be the last straw). I can't do some workouts because of it -- fitness used to be so helpful for me. 

Before I moved in with him, I was stuck in my room for hours at a time, except to go to the bathroom, for fear of encountering my parents. By the time I moved here, I was in a state of perpetual panic. My doctor had mercy and gave me a steady supply of anti-anxiety meds to get me through the last month or so for the panic attacks. At one point I called 911, thinking I was having a heart attack. 

So when I moved in with him, I needed time to adjust to my new environment. I needed time to learn how to live again - while still in horrible bladder pain and suffering CPTSD. 

When he'd criticize me for the cleaning, after first trying to calmly discuss it with him... going so far as to write out a whole thing explaining myself and asking for his patience and support... when he criticized me, I collapsed like an abandoned child and cried my eyes out.  It hurt so much to hear, ""YOU ARENT DOING ANYTHING!"" after explaining calmly to him that I do care, and want to try my best...

It's not like he sat down with me and calmly laid out expectations. He just got angry and shamed me when I didn't meet them. 

Many months went by and I became so low that I was just stuck on the couch staring at the wall much of the time. I think, subconsciously, I was afraid if I did clean more and work through my pain/fatigue, I wouldn't be able to handle the shaming. If I didn't do as much as I possibly could, cleaning-wise, at least his shaming words would be accurate. 

Don't get me wrong, I kept trying. I took all our laundry down 16 floors and back up with a cart. I tried my best to eat in to save money (failed at that of course). I kept going to therapy and worked hard to find all new doctors in my new location. I kept fighting to learn mindfulness meditation and self-compassion...hoping that if I could learn to just love myself, I wouldn't need love from him. That way, he could stop being so bothered by me wanting to cuddle and spend more time with him than he wants to spend with. 

""You don't know what it's like to have a job!"" ""Time goes faster for me than it does for you!"" ""You're letting your anxiety win. If you would just listen to me it would solve your problem.""

I've worked hard to become aware, and accepting of, present-day reality. It's still a struggle. It feels so surreal. This man, who said ""I am gonna love you so much"" -- I now feel like he regrets meeting me. 

The vibes I get from him are so strange now.  Sometimes he can hug me and it seems like he's trying to show me he cares. He knows I'm very down about all this and have been trying hard to save the relationship and be upfront and tell him about how we have hurt each other...

But the vibes are so strange. He often feels so cold and distant. I used to internalize this and feel ashamed, like I must not deserve love and fondness and affection.  I know I cannot read his mind, but it feels like he feels he is better than me and is unfortunate to have me around. 

His brother killed himself. He knows I'm extreme down and has known this for years. Yet it feels like he doesn't really care if I kill myself. He said he does, but it doesnt feel that way. 


I feel as hideous as I did in 8th grade when this one asshole kid kept telling me I'm ugly and putting me down all year - the same kid who also sexually assaulted me (not rape just a small thing), saying, ""Oh my god, I love you so much.""

The vibes here feel similar. He says he loves me, and cares about me... but if we go out together, he barely even touches me or talks to me. Even at home he feels so distant so much of the time. We can sit and watch a tv show and feel almost normal though, sometimes.  

Guys, don't tell me to leave. I'm still sick. I have 3 years of school, $19,000 in student loans, a chronic bladder pain condition that hurts like a bitch 24/7, and no - I mean absolutely NO - friends or family. I cannot move back in with my parents. 

I wish I could go back to school, but I have this pain and these loans. I need to get a job first, and I can barely stand to wash the dishes or brush my teeth. How am I supposed to work?

I've pushed for the dynamics to change in my relationship and he seems somewhat receptive. Some of the shaming has stopped. The weekends are hard but I'm trying to use them as an opportunity to tell him, ""its not okay when you talk to me like this.""

I've looked up emotionally abusive relationships and it seeems to fit in some ways. But when I tell him ways he has hurt me, sometimes he is receptive. And sometimes he gets angry and says it's for some reason. He said, ""you've behaved more fucked up than me. I refuse to believe you've just been some sort of victim.""  He has apologized for some things - saying he understands that in the beginning he said he would care for my happiness, but then my needs didn't matter enough. 

Within the first month of us being together, he got mad at me for buying a tube of mac foundation.  He stormed out with me, acting cold and angry. I had to ask like 5 times ""what's wrong, please just tell me"" before he scolded me for ""just wasting money like that.""  This is before we were living together and we hadn't even talked about money at that point, and it was not his money that I spent. 

He has hung up on me so many times when I was crying my eyes out. Now that I live here, he has fallen asleep many nights while I'm crying my eyes out. 

And guys, I am ugly. I try my best, do my hair/makeup, try to keep relatively fit whilst being in nonstop pain... try to go to therapy, try to be mindful and compassionate and learn about relationships... I am so lonely and so desperate and feeling so trapped and hopeless I do not know how or why to go on. 

I still feel so fucking confused about this relationship. There has been this theme for years, that until I _____, he cannot treat me the way I want to be treated. It used to make sense when I was ""harassing"" him and wanting him to pay attention to me. But now I'm actually getting a little better at the cleaning and not even bothering him yet he still feels so distant and I am feeling so ugly. 

Am I really so hideous I stand no chance at having a career, or do people treat me differently because I give off insecure, ""easily victimized"" vibes?

And for the sake of honesty, we used to be a dominant/submissive couple. He said he would care for my happiness in exchange for me being a sort of servant for him. I just thought it'd be sexy and an alternative, fun way to do a relationship.  He seemed so in love with me in the beginning. :(

I'm not good at making friends. I have bad anxiety. I spend my time over analyzing things. I get on here and talk to guys and sometimes show them my body so I'll feel validated. I had a crush on this guy and he found out and didn't like me back and now all his friends talk about me. I was with this guy who said we were ""dating"" only to see that he didn't like me that much and was probably talking to other girls. I can't get help for my depression because my mom thinks it's a manifestation of demons and refuses to believe I have it. Back to the friends thing, I try to make plans with people I wanna get to know better and everyone always turns me down. What's the fucking point if I've been rejected, betrayed, ignored, and looked down on???? I don't see none. People say it's get better, but they've been saying that since I was 12 and getting talked about and ignored by people at church. It's only gotten worse for me here.

205167,"A short story on a lousy life.I know my writing's gonna look a bit unrefined, but goddamnit: I almost had a car crash last night - so excuse me if my writing's a bit edgy at the moment.

I will begin by saying that I was around 12 when most of my troubles started. I don't really want to reveal to much about myself during those days, but suffice it to say that I was your average, Pokemon-playing doormat. Went to 4 different schools throughout high school, if I recall correctly. I can't say I remember much about the details about each of them - but I can tell you that I remember the namecalling, the shoves, the gropes, the spitting and the sheer worthlessness I experienced since then.

It got to the point where I had to practically ditch the schools at the age of 16.

I did eventually get a GED soon after a brief stint with a ""Jesus-Christ-rides-a-raptor""-type homeschooling program. The GED, however, did not diminish my desire to go find my school records and perform a Jay-and-Silent-Bob road trip on those fuckers. But the fact remains that despite how much I may want to perform said trip, I don't have the time, the will or the resources to do it.

I once wished that after all of this was over, I'd finally be able to catch a fucking break, but no... life just kept doling out the punishment. Take my current job, for instance: Right now I'm stuck giving night school classes to the same types of motherfuckers that made my life a living hell... And of course, some people might ask me: ""wouldn't that make you as contemptuous and judgemental as they were?"" Maybe. But it's hard to worry about that when I'm not even able to carry a conversation.

The lack of communication skills, unfortunately, is not the only idiosyncrasy that makes my life difficult. Take this one, for instance: I can remember vast amounts of data, but only a handful of names. I can also process that data for hours on end, but then I can't stop thinking about it when I try to sleep. I get twitches, tics, and tremors. I feel numb every time I see some sort of gathering. And top it all off, I have a brain that won't cease to remind me of nearly every gaffe, altercation and mistake I've experienced over the last 2 decades.

My biggest source of regret, though, comes from my inclination for following instructions. I did the errands that they wanted me to do. I went to the college that they told me to go. I didn't go to parties. I didn't get any action. I just spent my time in my room and studied for 4 consecutive years. ( Just like a good little boy... :-/ )

And now that I'm supposedly ""free,"" I can't even choose something as simple as a juice flavor.

But then again, it's not like there's many choices in this town. There are no people to talk to in here. There are no places to go. There's only a couple of bars, a downtown district on life support and a shopping center with a Walmart. All this crap is further aggravated by the fact that I can't even move - for I don't have the money to do so.

I've gone thru the usual recommendations I hear around Reddit, too. I go to my psychiatrist. I've gone thru a couple of psychologists. I take my antidepressants - but I don't even know if taking them makes any difference. I also tried going to the gym for about six months. And even that became a tedious routine.

I try not to complain, though. Most of the time, people would just point out the pettyness of my problems. And the times when that doesn't happen, I just get that useless ""everything will be alright"" bullshit.

I did, however, manage to get something out of these ordeals. I now know that life is, in its essence, pain. What I don't know is whether or not I want to stick around for that much longer.",suicide

205169,"I think it's finally overI'm turning 30 in a few months. I've done enough for everyone else. Everything I love is being destroyed by covid. I wanted to travel, that was my whole life's goal. to see the world for what it was instead of just how america sees it. Now, impossible, unsafe. I have an autoimmune disorder so I've been in the house since late january when this all started. 

Food either sucks or my stomach rejects it. Sleep sucks, too many nightmares from being abused my whole life or pain from my idiot body. No friends, just people who use me when it suits them. Partner, but he's emotionally deaf to me. Job's gone, no one needs luxury industries in a pandemic. Apartment complex won't renew my lease so I'll probably be homeless as soon as they're allowed to evict people again. 

I'm in constant pain, my whole body is covered in sores that hurt and are disgusting. My joints are all fucked up. I have sex almost never and my whole job revolved around it for so long I got desensitized to it, so I can't even enjoy that anymore when i get over everything else and manage to try to do it. 

Everything that made me human has been taken from me. I wish I had done this to myself so I could at least feel like these feelings were unreasonable self hate. But honestly I've just been kicked, and kicked, and kicked, and I'm so tired of getting back up.

I left a note the gentlest way I possibly could. In a place he might never even find it, and that's ok. I'm deciding method, between a couple things, but my options are limited since I'm disabled and I might have to do something ugly. 

I don't honestly know why I'm posting here. I think maybe it's because I feel like I -need- to scream into the void one last time. I've never used reddit for anything before and I generally find it a breeding ground for bullshit. 

Everyone tells me to have hope, that things will get better. I have doctors, I have a therapist, I have people who ""take care"" of me but my life doesn't get better, it just gets worse. I can't tell if they're just not doing their job and I'm too stupid to notice or if I'm so abused I see even the worst doctor as ""hey, at least someone is even looking at my open wound"".  


Bottom line is, I want to die while I still remember who I was. Between mental illness, pain, beliefs being stripped from me, I'm slowly dwindling away and I don't like what's been left behind. I wish there was any other answer, any other escape from the constant pain, but I've tried everything. I've 100%'ed every video game I loved as a child, watched every movie that used to make me smile, read every book, listened to every scary story, hugged my dogs, tried eating good food all of which my body rejected,  but being trapped in this room for the rest of my life is too much to bear. 

I hope, whoever you are, you realize how good you have it. I hope to hug the people in your life - the only person I have to hug is someone who also slammed me into the ground in an airport parking lot. I hope you love your families, if you have them at all, because my mother raped me for 17 fucking years. I hope you enjoy a good meal once in a while, and try things you don't think you'd like, because between my 3 stomach disorders I can basically eat white rice and boiled chicken breast without severe pain. I hope you enjoy the sun, because I can't. I hope you take deep breaths, and calm yourself, because I can't.  I hope you enjoy your freedoms - knowing who you are, knowing what's going on around you, knowing what you need, and the power to change things - because I have none of those things. Realize how fucking good you have it.",suicide
205170,"I've been unemployed over a year and am running out of options. If I don't get anything in the next few months, I've made the decision to kill myself.I know that often times when there's a message posted like this in any sort of public forum, there's an assumption that the person on the other side is not thinking straight or is mentally unwell.  

That's not the case here.  I've actually put a lot of thought into this, considered it thoroughly, and have concluded that there's only one logical outcome.

I have been unemployed for over a year now.  I have networked, applied, considered other cities, everything.  I have done everything that is expected of me and then some.

I also have no resources left.  I've begun to live off of the charity of others, and I know that has its limits.

The constant rejection from potential employers and my inability to provide anything to those offering me support is telling me one thing plainly: I have no value whatsoever to this world.  

That in mind, there's only one solution.  I'm going to kill myself.  I'm going to give myself a little more time to see if anything happens.  And if it doesn't, I'm spending what money I have left to take one last vacation to enjoy life fully before I end it.

205172,"I dont think I'm needed or worth anything anymoreThere was a time I was worth it and needed. I was the top 10 of class A and, although I really didn't join any amazing contests, partially because my parents didn't want to and partially because I wasn't that good for interschool contests. But, I still had high grades. I was worth it, I was loved by my parents. My friends sometimes come for me to ask questions, so there was a time I was needed.


There was a time I was needed. Although I recieved my first C- (it was Calculus, btw), I still aced most of my classes. Despite sucking at calculus, I never once thought of cheating or doing any underhanded way to ""win"" against my classmates. My parents were disappointed, sure, but some of my friends still came to me when they needed a study buddy or homework helper. My parents didn't like it though, and tried to restrict my time doing other things regarding my studies. Sometimes they catch me, sometimes I get away scot-free. I didn't care, even though I wasn't worth as much anymore, people still needed me. 


Of course, for me to remain needed, I had to pick the course who's requisites were the things I already topped in. I was good in Chemistry and Math (sans Calculus), and although I suck at Physics, I thought Chemical Engineering was cool, so thats what I pursued.


There was a time when I was just a mediocre student. When I first entered the university, I felt how small I was compared to my classmates (or competitors, if you want to put it that way). All of them were scholars and in the honors program and were people who never, ever saw a grade below B. I wasn't a scholar, but was still part of honors program, so maybe I just wasn't that good as them, but was good enough for honors. That was fine, I might not be needed anymore, but I was still worth the honors stuff.


There was a time where I was the friend and I was the burden to others. I started getting subpar grades in college usually only seeing 2.5 to 3.5's. My suckiness in Physics and Calculus brought my grade down to 3 point somethings CGPA. I was always asking, always researching, looking for ways to cover the gap between my grades to that of my peers. I always overworked a certain person who I always, always pestered when I really don't understand anything. But it wasn't enough. I started getting 1.0's and 1.5's. But, my CGPA was still teetering in the honors CGPA, so I guess...


And now, all my grades are failing, in the middle of a pandemic. I'm pretty sure I'll fail a major this term. My parents know, ofc, they tell me how much of a failure, good for nothing person I was. At first, I retailiated, I told them how I'm not a failure, how I'm still worth something, although much less than before. But... I think they're right, because if they're wrong, I should've proved them wrong a long time ago.

(I didn't. I couldn't.)



I'll be forced to shift. From being a person who is worth it and needed, to being a person who has been nothing but a bother, a nuisance and a waste of space. 


Maybe the best end for a waste of space is...

I don't often put my feelings out in the open but I am very grateful for organizations such as the Suicide Hotline as well as this subreddit.

I called after a night of heavy drinking as my grandfather had just died. I have struggled with depression, alcoholism and self harm, and I was worried that I may hurt myself. So, I called. I never envisioned myself, as a 27 year old man, to be someone to call a crisis hotline.

I am more than thankful I did. The woman on the other line was one of the most compassionate, understanding and overall nicest human beings I've had the pleasure to talk to.

I would give anything to thank her over and over until she was annoyed with me.

I haven't been on this sub for quite some time, even before I wasn't really to active but I came by quite some times. Either to read some of the stuff that people say and try to relate or to just try and answere in a meaningfull way. This sounds nicer than it acctualy is since I only ever use reddit when I am at work. I barely take a look at it when I leave. While I love reddit it only really functions as a waste of time to not think about stuff while I am at work. It's not just reddit, I just play games all day long in my free time. I'm not sure anymore if I even enjoy playing, or if it only is a method of distracting myself. To get to the point before I bore myself with this too, I am in a quite shitty situation, while I hate my job because I just sit in front of a pc all day long, with a social interaction of a max of 5min, I also can't stand it at home (Yeah quite the young one, 20 to be exact). Either I leave my job but won't get enough money to get a place myself, or I stay where I work currently and manage to acctualy move into another place. While this maybe sounds easy to handle for a lot of people out there it certainly is not. I mean at least for me. Both options are shit and either way I don't have any motivation at all to do anything usefull or meaningfull. What is this feeling about not wanting to exist anymore, while not wanting to acctualy die. What the fuck is it that keeps me here.

Release comes unexpectedly, it comes in flashes when it paralyses you for moments, minutes, hours, the timeline isn't determined. 

Life is truly beautiful, the moments of happiness, the moments of sadness, the moments of joy, the moments of pain. Embrace. Feel. Be present with. Release. When we feel something that is wanting to come out, we have to allow it, cry through, be present with it and even though it might question, have we grown? We have to look at everything that has been done, focused on, changed since that moment of initial cause. 

Breathe. Crying is powerful. Sitting in emotions is powerful. Being with yourself and giving that time for yourself is powerful. Healing comes in the form of accepting all emotions, not just ""being happy"". Goosebumps. Wide awake.

I met H. when we were 17. My current boyfriend had broken up with me, and without getting over it, jumped into a relationship with H. He was patient and kind and I was nightmarish. Volatile, hateful. I had no semblance of what a healthy relationship was. I didn't (and still don't) know how to recognize when someone actually loved me.

We were together for 4 years until we broke up for what seemed like the final time. The thing is, H. was sick the entire time I'd known him. Cancer. But I was still always an unrelenting bitch. He had a bit of an ego on him, I guess, but you couldn't blame him too much. He had a genius IQ and had dealt with crazy family members his whole life. Did he ever catch a fucking break? Reason 1 I feel like dying. H. did not deserve the life he was dealt. Good boy, sweet boy.

I started a relationship with someone else. A few months later, H. wants to get back together. I panic. I tell him I'm single. I'm now in 2 relationships. 

2 years pass, H. gets sicker. I feel guilty even kissing him, because of Boyfriend #2. I am a shitty girlfriend, I am a shitty person. But I love him. He loves me even though I am a bad person. And he is smart and perfect. He grows sicker still. I get bored when he talks too much about YouTube videos because he's not able to leave the house and socialize. My agoraphobia and depression make it hard for me to visit him often, and I am a bad person  for it. I foolishly believe he will get better and that I will handle the polyamorous thing when it absolutely has to be handled. 

H. dies in his sleep. Unexpected.

Month pass. Month pass. I am tired. People continue to come up short for me by comparison. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. And then I can be with my baby. ",suicide

205237,"I don't see the point in livingThis isn't a depressive post, I just really do not see the point in living. Especially if most of the events you experience every day are usually either neutral or negative, then I don't see why you wouldn't kill yourself. The cost/benefit analysis of life seems to be favoring the costs and looks to be an investment that doesn't pay off.

I feel that most of you will give the advice that it's because of love, or just being happy doing the things you love, but I don't see the point in doing those things if you know you won't be the best at them. Statistically it's pretty much 100% likely you won't be the best or even close to being ""great"" at something, so why do it if you know you're going to be constantly outperformed by someone else or a lot of ""someone else's""? Especially if you're into an art form or in a performance field; your fans will enjoy someone else more than you, and it's highly unlikely that you'll be a star. 

This holds true for attractiveness and personality traits as well. If you're not going to be the most attractive (whether it be physically or personality-wise or both) person then why begin a relationship or a friendship? There will always be some other person that that person (whether it be a friend or a girlfriend/boyfriend) will enjoy being around more, be more compatible with, admire more, or be happier around than you.


And I know this sounds extremely negative, but try to take it in objectively. There's no hidden meaning in here, these are just my ruminations. And maybe some people are happy with not being the best (I think this is valid for careers/hobbies, but not for relationships) and I can understand that.

In no way do I want to be transgender because I know even if I get surgery and change my identity, I still won't be able to be a ""normal"" guy (biologically , genetically and socially speaking, I will always be ""trans"" and not a real ""guy""). There will always be that fear of being revealed as a ""trans"" and having people judge you: I will always have scars from the transition to remind myself that ""no, you will never be a normal guy"". You will always have to worry about potential friends/lovers being uncomfortable around you. There is a long list of reasons why I am so desperate of wanting to be a guy (ever since I was a child) but I will not bore you with the details here.

Coming from an Asian family, being gay is basically the most shameful thing that could happen to anyone. With that being said, my parents are not accepting at all and commonly throw insulting comments at how I'm ""dirty, disgusting, abnormal and useless"".  They would much rather have a daughter who was dead instead of having a homosexual daughter. We have an extremely strained relationship, not to mention how controlling they are (I'm 21 and I still have a curfew of 9pm). Moving out isn't an option due to money issues but I'm saving up!

To make matters worse, my gf of 4.5 years just told me she didn't want to go on anymore because she wants a bf. I understand that there is no one at fault and of course, I wish her the best.

Seeing that it is impossible to achieve true happiness, what is the point of living? Please don't tell me to live for my family or friends as I truly feel that my family would be much happier without me. Adopting a buddhist viewpoint of reincarnation...I was hoping to end it now and just move on with the cycle hoping I would be able to be born a guy/ or anything else in my next life.

I've felt like I've pretty much seen the world...coming from a somewhat well off family, I've travelled to many beautiful countries, I drive a nice car, I've loved, cried, been happy, been angry, been disappointed, I've experienced all the feelings I could, seen most of the world, posses many material possessions many people yearn for, yet I am still desperate to find a reason to go on like this...

Thinking black people are inferior is racist, as is thinking white people are, and Asian people as well as any other race.

Men can be raped too not just women.

Just because I don't like a person that happens to be homosexual I am not homophobic.

Just because I don't like the way certain homosexuals shove their homosexuality in my face I am not homophobic.

Callmecarson is not a pedo but he is kind of stupid, if a 17 and 19 year old is a pedophilia then most highschool relationships would go bye-bye.

Thinking women are better than men is equally as sexist as thinking men are better.

I can eat meat if I want, don't show me animals getting slaughtered unless you want me to punch a hole in your laptop.

Fortnite or any other game that is toxic is toxic because of the community and not the game, appreciate the hard work of others.

Cyberpunk had a ton of bugs because people pressured them into releasing it early.

An older woman engaging in sexual stuff with a male minor is still pedophilia.

If a girl hits you then you have every right to hit back but it is still a bad decision since you shouldn't hit people.

If I took enough I probably couldn’t move and panic in the psychotic state it would induce.

I took the advice I was given here last time and talked to my family. It did nothing. I took a big risk and tried psychedelics; it’s a big risk because I’m an addict in recovery. The psychedelics didn’t help either. 9 separate diagnoses, so many meds, so many psych hospitalizations. Nothing works, and I want the ups and downs to stop. All my thoughts lead to death or suicide eventually. Just constant suicidal thoughts.

I was looking into the exit bag method. But the Helium pricks started making it 20% oxygen so it’s no longer viable. If someone has a way then please tell me. It’d be more helpful than harmful. I was waiting on one thing to happen before I took myself out. Now she’s good, and I don’t have to worry about adversely affecting her health. A bit narcissistic to think I would.

My boyfriend at the time found out I'd cheated on him,broke up with me, which was understandably my own fault. What wasn't my fault was the way he messed up and played around in my head afterwards. He said some awful things, they don't need to be mentioned. So I did what I knew I was good at and picked up the vodka bottle, drinking it straight, but it wasn't helping. So I started eating painkillers like sweets. After about 40 pills and half a bottle of vodka I started getting warm, itchy skin, itchy scalp. So I sat in the shower, fully clothed, crying, with cold water flowing over me to try and cool myself down. I then had to get up, run to the toilet and start vomiting uncontrollably. It was at this point I knew I'd made a huge mistake. Cried even more. The only person I could think to tell was the guy who had caused this, so I did, and he came over, where I must have passed out and vomited 30+ times. But hospital was not an option, I couldn't let my mother know what a failure and mess her daughter had wound up. After a few days I was starting to feel better and realised how stupid I'd been. I got clean, no drugs, no drinking, my head felt so much better!
I stayed that way until I was 17. I started drinking heavily again after dropping out of college, I started sniffing amphetamines again, cocaine, mephedrone, i smoked weed and even crack. I was a disaster again, and again the suicidal thoughts came back. But this time i didn't actively act on them, i was just slowly destroying myself with drugs. And i loved it. After a year and a half of constant drug taking and partying, i got a real wake up call when I'd start blacking out from pills i was taking to calm me down, which started doing the opposite and would cause me to black out and get aggressive against others and myself. So again i cleaned up my act, went back to college, passed a computing course and even got my first job, working as a tax advisor for HM Revenue and Customs. It was a well paid job, but also a very demoralizing one at times, so i went back to my old ways, ended up getting sacked from that job, got fucked up and went back off the rails. 
Now we're pretty much to now. I'm still unemployed, burried in debt that I've hidden from everyone around me, back on drugs that very few people know about, I dont have many friends, no boyfriend, my life is spiralling out of control faster than i can stop it and it just seems like the only way to stop it would be to try harder at what i failed at when i was 15. I really don't want to ever have to experience the worst thing that i have again, but it seems like the best way. And even as i write this, i am crying so much. I don't know what to do and i don't feel like I could burden ny friends or family with my worries, i cant bring myself to talk to strangers in person so therapy isn't really an option for me.

It's so utterly horrifying to want to die, to have the capacity to become your own executioner. I don't know how I'll feel tomorrow, but something was shuffled out in that darkness. Shaking. 

What a misadventure. I thought I'd have a little fun last night before I jumped and went to a bar because it had my name on the sign, but before I knew it, I was led into some bizarre gambling parlor. So weird. A closed room with slack-jawed gamblers smoking and stuffing dollars into machines. I offered 20 bucks to the person who could give me the best secret. They laughed and I got them talking. I didn't get any secrets, but I convinced a couple women to talk about love. I forgot how fucking devious I am when I'm drunk and traveling.  

Then I went to another bar that was unfortunately named after my rapist (weirdness). More drinking and I successfully convinced some kid that I was journalist before almost passing out. A swarm of women rescued me and called a cab. Like it was no big deal. Hey, woman passing out in a bar, nbd. I've been isolating for so long, I forgot that I'm not entirely hideous and some creepy dudes were circling over me like fucking pterodactyls, so these local women propped me up in a chair and gave me water until the cab came. I don't think I paid, but I remember the guy telling me he had 18 years of sobriety. Fucking strangers. 

So I spent most of the day hungover in this fucking hotel without my car or credit card, pissed that I got too sloppy to do the deed. Just tossing around in the muck of myself, waiting to die, taking pills, terrified, thinking of all the people I know who understand how to live well. Fantasizing I was one of them, trying to find a place in my mind that felt safe. 

I finally found a cab and got my car and was still ready to do it. I don't know what happened. I hadn't eaten all day. I was shaking and terrified. Then I got angry. Why should I fucking die because men rape and beat women and no one believes us? Why should I die because no one understands how dangerous benzodiazapines are?

Anyway, I drove for hours and feel different. I even managed to have a conversation with my friend and make plans for the weekend, maybe even go to a party tomorrow. I don't know how long it will last. I guess I'll throw myself into trying to get sober. They say to try it for a year.

I had an attempt in December. My whole life I've struggled with an array of mental problems and I used to go to the bathroom, turn off the lights, run the shower real hot and just sit in the steam to bring myself down. In December I used that shower as my way of swallowing my pills to try to take my life. Now I am safe.. somewhat. I have not really found a bounce back but since then I haven't actively wanted to try. Well.. kind of. 
I've still had a lot of mental problems and medication adjustments but unfortunately the diagnosis I have can't really be medicated to help me be stable, only therapy and anxiety pills. So I find myself still sitting in dark bathrooms crying in steam. Recently my shower moments have been getting more frequent and I've noticed I have begun to self harm and want to self harm but only when I'm in the bathroom. I have moved out of the house I attempted in (it was an awful reminder) but I think showers as a whole are triggering. Since my attempt I haven't wanted to shower because I do feel kinda cruddy when I take them but when I'm already in a foul mood they are impossible to get through without an anxiety attack. I had one bad enough the other night that even hearing the sound of water falling pushed me into an attack.
So my question here I guess is does anyone else have specific triggers from past attempts they're willing to share? And how have you overcome them? I'm also speaking to a therapist and my loved ones about this topic but I wanted to have a conversation with people that have actually gone through or are going through similar experiences. 
Thank you. And be safe everyone. ",suicide

The truth is I knew this day would come. I know how dead I am inside, how worthless I feel, I know how I look into a mirror, and hate what I see, I see everyone I've lost in my life.

I fight, and I fight for everyone I've cared about, but the truth is they don't need me, not like I need them. Perhaps I'm still that scared little boy, because nobody loved me enough as a child, I was clearly not the favorite, even when there was a fight they showed more concern for them than they ever did for me.

What do you want me to say, it doesn't matter, I don't matter. Some say they see a way out, they can see a light at this ugly ass tunnel, but I don't. It's over for me.

I can't save myself, everyone tries to fix it, but I keep dragging everyone down. So I'm not gonna beg. If it's my time, then it is my time.

I'm tired guys, I'm tired of this job, this life, this weight on my shoulders I'm tired of it. Am I gonna give up now? I mean am I just gonna lay down and wait to die, would it be so wrong to let it all end?

I don't want to fight no more, I'm tired of fighting. I don't need to feel like hell for failing myself, for failing everyone, like I fail every other godforsaken thing I care about, I don't need it. 

Perhaps I didn't deserve everything that was put onto me, maybe I don't deserve to die, but believe me when I say this, I have tried everything, everything, and I got one card left to play and I HAVE to play it. So maybe it will be okay, but It's not okay, good thing there's always a second way out, I can't lie to myself that I haven't been thinking about it. I tell myself that will never happen, but I know I can see it. Perhaps I'm wrong, maybe I'm wrong for wanting quit.

months later i follow his gf on instagram. she follows me back. proceeds to rub it in for the next three hours about how much he loves her but about how bad of a gf she is to him. i begrudgingly give her advice bc again, if he’s happy i should be happy.

a month later i get a text. from the dude. he got dumped and is now crawling back to me(oh how surprised i was-_-). i proceed to be his emotional support for two months.

then he sends me a shirtless snap and starts ghosting me on and off for the next three months.

and today i just found out that our exes go to the same goddamn school.

so should i laugh, cry, or both?",non-suicide

If the Athiest's are right and ""God"" is a complete fucking hoax, then I will be able to rest in eternal oblivion, where there is no pain, and I can simply sleep forever.

If the Christians and Muslims are right, then I will hopefully go to ""heaven"" where I will be free from the misery that is life itself. And if there is a ""hell"", than it surely can't be that terrible, as I've came to a point where pain means nothing to me.

As for the Hindu and Buddhists, if such a phenomenon like reincarnation is real, then I will be given a new opportunity at life, one that will hopefully be better than the one I put myself into.

I say this because I know I have felt worse in my life; it's just hard for me to say when the last time it was that I've felt this low.

I don't have an interesting life. I'm only 18. Up until I was 13, I had basically no friend. In 8th grade, I fell in love with my best friend at the time. She was perfect and I became infatuated with her, but I asked her out and she rejected me. I was heartbroken, and I became obsessed with the idea of her until the end of 9th grade. It was then that I met a girl with interest in me, but she spent the entire summer flip-flopping her stances on whether or not she liked me. Finally she decided on no; I was lost and confused and I turned to a friend who lives a few states away. We talked every day. Every day. We began dating long-distance in 10th grade, but it ended two months later. I rekindled things with the girl from the summer before and we became best friends, and I began to treat her just like I had the others. Eventually she turned out terrible, and I felt lost again, gaining the affection for another girl who coincidentally lived far away. We remained friends until after my senior year of high school (only months ago) when I found out that she didn't feel for me the way I felt about her.

Tonight, I realized something horrifying. The night that the most recent girl and I had parted ways, I began speaking to a different old friend. It is now four months later, and upon finding out that she doesn't care for me to the same level that I do her, I realized: I'm still running on the same steam that has fueled all of these failed relationships. All of these events. I'm shocked and horrified because every time that I've ever felt like I succeeded at getting away, it turned out that I had not. I just changed girls. And I thought it was over many times before, but it wasn't. I've just been changing her face and her name.

And basically, I feel worthless. I feel like my entire life is made of shit. My day was amazing until this realization, and I'm shocked that I feel so low. I practice self-awareness and constantly tell myself how beautiful life is. I basically have been able to keep myself from sinking so low because of these thoughts, but... I don't even know.

\-went home after just one month, couldnt finish my contract.

\-disappointed everyone i know, and everybody thinks im a useless fuck. I also feel that way about myself by the way.

\-family convinced mo to go back to the job.

\-tried reapplying at a different company.

\-got rejected cause they saw my record from the previous company.

\-got depressed, stop talking to everyone.

\-bought a NO2 cylinder, and made my own exit bag.

\-about to pull the trigger on myself.

and By the way i worked at a call center for a short time too, and i fucking hated it so i quit after just 4 months, so me not being able to go back on ships mean me going back to call centers means me just better off killing myself instead of enduring daily life a fucking customer service bullshit.

I was tested and the result was that 97.4% of all tested kids were happier than I was. I was in therapy and was doing pretty okay for a long time.

I'm in boarding school now (own wish) and I fell in love twice this year. First girl was on the verge of killing herself, I was in love with her and when I heard about how she felt I wanted to help her, as a sort of ""thank you"", after I cried all night because of fear for her after she had a panic attack and needing medical attention, she searched through her stuff in boarding school when I was in her room, drinking booze she herself said tasted awful infront of me and after gaining enough confidence disappearing with someone else and spending the whole evening with him and that booze. It's no secret what happened that night. Now she doesn't even greet me and I am sorta required to act as if I never knew her anyways. The second girl I met at the dancing course I go to in my hometown. I was only there because my parents didn't remember when a old friend of mine went dancing so I was in the wrong class. This was the first time in the course (20+ weeks) the girls chose their partners, and this pretty girl that's exactly my type walked up to me and we danced for the rest of the class. She added me on Instagram and we chatted every day for the rest of the weekend. Until I was in the train, driving back to boarding school, where I only received half of her messages and the chat ended with her being really frustrated. The next day when I wrote her she said she was learning. I wrote her that when she doesn't have time she can tell me, no problem, that I don't want to force her to have a chat with me when she has no time. She said it was okay. So the next day, on Tuesday, I asked her when she comes home from school she read it but didn't answer. 5 hours later I wrote ""no it's okay"" under quotation marks, clearly frustrated because she ignored me. She hasn't answered since, but yesterday I wrote that I'm sorry how the week after the dancing lesson developed, telling her how good she looked that day and how I miss her smile and asked if we'd still meet next week at the next dancing lesson. She read it but hasn't answered for more than 24 hours. On Instagram I saw that she spent today with her friends at an Asian restaurant, having fun and laughing a lot, while I'm at my phone, having forgotten what I was even waiting for. An answer? I don't know anymore. I felt empty the whole day, having spent most of my power to write that message and sending it. I started thinking about death again this week, possibly Thursday. My roommate wasn't here so I was pretty lonely because I neither wanted to go out, nor chat with anyone, fearing my internet would be used up before she answered me. I didn't sleep much this week and since Thursday I think about getting hit by trucks, getting shot, stabbed, being caught up in a terrorist attack, with other people getting hit by a truck and me helplessly trying to protect my girl and later giving first aid to the victims, fighting for their lives, then, in a different dream seeing the girl I love dying in front of me, or asking myself if that girl in class which is really salty since she knows I'm in love would miss me when the class would be told I'd never come to school again. I could possibly continue writing about all these thoughts and dreams, in which I or my girl die, indefinitely. I don't understand why this is happening. I don't do my favorite sport for months now, neither do I play the instrument I love so dearly since childhood days. I feel empty most of the time, except the days I was in love (Friday till Thursday) with who I believe is the right one. I am the son of a single mum and she already told me when I was a child that she couldn't go on if I'd no longer be, so suicide is a no-no (I think), but I still dream about dying. Do I want to die? I don't know! I definitely don't want to continue being ignored by people I could die for, neither do I want them to not answer or writing me without ever telling me why. I've talked about the girls with the lesbian sister of my roommate and how upset and unmotivated I am, but I haven't told her about all these thoughts and dreams. She is really caring. Should I talk to her or should I talk to my ex-therapist (I think I'd only waste his time with me ""teenage love bullshit"")? 

*tl:dr:* I was suicidal as a child and battled depression. I lived some normal years since then but after two separate girls I fell in love with so strongly I would risk my life to save them ignore me and don't answer me without ever telling my why, I feel empty and only think about dying and suicide again. I don't really do anything anymore, but I know my mother would kill herself if I commited suicide, which would mean the end of my family which is documented back to the 1200s.

I feel like I've said everything that I need to.

I don't speak to my father, my mother is dead, she died on November 3, 2015, right before Thanksgiving and the holiday season. When that happened I lost the light in my life. I was 20 years old. My brother, my last living family member, is 800+ miles away and hardly speaks to me even after I continuously reach out. My step-father, after being sober for three years, recently relapsed and refuses help. I feel like I'm alone in this world.

I work and I pay my bills, I do everything that I'm supposed to do but that's all I do. I got clean from drugs because I thought that would make me feel better but I just feel worse. I've tried to get better but it doesn't work, it never does; I don't know why I even try.

I hardly talk to people outside of work aside from my boyfriend, but he can't be there 24/7 and I can't expect him to be. I can't expect him to cradle me every time I get depressed. I have my cat and I don't know what will happen to her after I do it, I know she'll miss me but it's hard to take that to heart, as fucked up as that sounds. It's just not enough. I wish she could talk so that I would have at least one friend in this world. My roommate has a cat and she absolutely adores mine, so I would probably leave my cat to her.

I know how I'm gonna do it. I think about it every day, I imagine the different scenarios and try to think of every way it could fail so I can plan around it. I finally found the other half to my plan but I can't get it for about a week or so. I want to get it by November 3 so I can do it then, I think it'll make it easier to accept if that's the case.

Over the course of the next week or so I'm going to pack stuff away in preparation, that way it'll be less of a mess to go through for my brother, my roommate, or my boyfriend.

205448,"HARRY POTTER and the Scandalous Love story of Hogwarts A now 24 year old Harry Potter laid his head on Hagrid's chest and inhaled his musty scent, his nose sucking up one of the man's many chest hairs by accident.

He didn't complain however, happy that now a piece of Hagrid would be inside of him.

""I love the way you hold me with those big, strong hands Hagrid.""

The now man who lived was feeling especially flirty tonight, and he was sure to let his lover know he was in the mood for some snoo snoo.

Luckily for him, it didn't take much to turn Hagrid on.

In just moments, he was more than ready to fill Potter's primal desires.

""And I love the way you let me wreck that asshole every night.""

Returning Harry's flirtacious advances, Hagrid lifted him up, and his lover wrapped his legs around the mans waist.

He quickly removed the wizard's robe and began to suck on his nipples, enjoying how sweet they tasted.

""I'll suck yours. Then you suck mine, alright?""

Harry simply nodded, his face twisted in pleasure.

At this moment, he didn't care what Hagrid wanted.

He'd do anything as long as he could keep feeling the way he felt currently.

The man's mouth game was godly.

Several minutes passed until it was Harry’s turn.

Though not quite as experienced as Hagrid, he had sucked on his reddit friend Demetri’s nipples many times before.

He was fairly confident in his nipple sucking abilities and would try to provide his lover with just as much pleasure as he had given to him.

Removing Hagrid's clothing layer by layer, the man's humongous pancake nipples finally became visible.

Potter stared wide eyed for a moment, taken back by how not even a tiny bit of man boob could be seen.

It seemed as though the man's chest consisted of hair and nipple, with nothing in between.

""Wow.""

That was all Harry could say.

He was both aroused and disgusted by the sight at the same time.

He didn't know whether he wanted to blow a load or vomit all over his lover's nipple rug of a chest.

Hagrid wasn't bothered by the reaction, and just let out a hearty laugh in response.

""They don't normally look like that, don't worry. I ran out of Ferrets for Buck Beak, so I had to feed him myself. You should've seen them a few days ago! Buck Beak nearly bit my right nipple clean off. A bloody mess, it was.""

Looking closer, the adult Harry could clearly see scarring on Hagrid's right nipple.

He sure was a brave man, letting such a dangerous beast feed from his nipples...

The wizard wondered what his lover's essence tasted like.

""Hagrid...""

""Yes, Harry?""

""C-Can I have a taste? I'm kind of hungry...""

Hearing this, a gentle smile formed on Hagrid's lips.

""Of course. Help yourself...”

The man pushed Harry closer to his chest, overjoyed when he felt him begin to suckle on his nipples.

The wizard was hesitant at first, but once he tasted how delicious his lover's milk was, he began to nurse.

Gulp after gulp, he chugged Hagrid's milk down, his lips stained with the man's nipple juices.

The hair tickled his cheeks and had made it difficult to grasp the nipples in his mouth at first, but with some assistance from his lover, he had quickly located them.

“That’s it my boy, just like that... Work that tongue.”

When Harry was finally finished, he released the nipple from his mouth and let out a loud burp.

His stomach was now full, and he was satisfied.

Hagrid looked down at him with the biggest grin he had ever seen, and they kissed passionately.

""Can we wait until the morning to touch winkies? The milk made me sleepy...""

Hagrid nodded, setting Harry down.

""Sure, first thing in the morning. I came in my pants while you were nursing, anyway."" Hagrid laughed. ""Buckbeak hates when I do that, but I just can't help it. Breast feeding turns me on.""

""Mmhmm.""

Harry Potter motioned for Hagrid to join him in bed, and the man complied.

The two snuggled up under the covers and spoke quietly for a while, telling the other how much they loved them. 

After a time, the pair drifted off to sleep, anticipating the anal that awaited Harry Potter in the morning.",non-suicide

I was suicidal for many reasons but it was mainly my poor grades and my lack of hope for the future. I really did turn myself around and vowed to never even think of suicide again.

I have friends (who I guess are close but I have major trust issues), my lovely parents, and a bright future (if I work hard this semester, I can go on exchange to Spain next semester amongst other things). Like I said though, things aren't perfect and I guess Im tired of trying to pretend they are, to myself. Ive always tried to let things slide by and remain happy because I didnt want to get into depression.

I am so miserable, day in and day out, with no one who depends on me or needs me.  My parent and my long distance partner would miss me, but I think they might both be better without me.  My partner has a very busy, full life and I'm sure I only bring them down.  My parent holds off on living their life due to having to watch over me during my bad times.

If I take a pregnancy test and it's negative, I think I might kill myself.  No one needs me.  Anyone who misses me would get over it quickly.  I know a child doesn't need a fucked up parent, but at least I would feel like I have a reason to live, someone who I can take care of, someone who needs me - someone whose life I can better.  I didn't think of this before unprotected sex, but as time goes on, I see my life is basically forfeit due to mental illness.  If I am not pregnant, I think it might finally be a safe and secure time to end my life.  If I am pregnant, I feel like I would finally have the motivation, something to live for, someone who will love and need me.

I'm not sure how I'll do it.  I'd like to see my partner one last time, but maybe not.  Maybe it is just best this way.

205509,"I can't take it anymoreThis is my first time typing something here and this might be long. I'm sorry if so.

I've been depressed for the past few years now. I'm 19 years old and right now I just feel like utter shit, like I'm hopeless and I cannot do one thing right that will make my parent(mother) be happy of me. I would say this started when I was in middle school, I got a bad grade in some class, I explained to my dad(who was on drugs on that time). He gets mad, grabs one of the medium-sized Jamaican heads we had in our home and he hits me with it. The next day I go to my school therapist to discuss what happened. Now before I had no idea what CPS was, but according to her what my father did was enough to make the call.

So she calls, later on when I get home my mom calls me into her room. And instead of understanding my choice she blatantly bashed me, telling me that I was the one in the wrong, not my father. I was ignored and treated like shit for months and I never once, even now, received something that made me feel my choice was okay from them.

Now into high school. At a young age my mom put me into track and field, a sport that I had a lot of talent in, even making it into the JO(Junior Olympics). However due to issues w/ money, my mom, bro, and I had to move to another city. Long story short I did pretty shitty in track, I still have no idea why. While I was good in track and received many calls about colleges wanting me in their school, it just wasn't...me. I was only doing it for my mother because I know how happy it made her. But one night after a track meet she yelled and screamed about how I was ""embarrassing"" her - as if she was the one running her ass off and trying to impress her daughter. So that was it. I told her I quit and I just didn't nothing. 

My grades dropped sorely and I even ran to my HS therapist to tell her I wanted to kill myself. She calls my mom, who glares at me as if again, I was the one in the wrong, then swiftly leaves. I spend time in a mental institute, get out a few days later only for my mom to immediately tell me how disappointed she is of me. 

During the span on my senior year and now, I have thought of suicide many many times, but only actually did an action twice. My last one was last May and I OD'd. I was in the mental hospital for a  week and only received visits from my father and my aunt(who I haven't spoken to for even seen prior for years). But guess who wasn't there for me? Right. My mother.

Just last week I told my mother I wanted to drop out of college because I literally had to motivate myself to go. Example, I would lie to her saying the class got canceled when it actually wasn't. I was tired of trying to make her and others proud of me. Instead I wanted to do something that would make MYSELF happy. Oddly enough, before she said I could do anything I wanted to do. And now that I actually decide it's just a giant shitstorm. She blackmails me about taking away my only connection to online friends(my irl friends abandoned me the moment I moved despite me sending texts to them). It was just around 15 minutes ago she called me into her room asking me what I did. I tell her since I'm depressed I stayed in bed and cried. However I did call a company for their app and prepared to send it to them tomorrow.

But no, she yells, tells me I won't get that job. Long story short, she wants to control my life and I won't let her. I've been under her roof since I was born, and don't get my wrong I would LOVE to move out. However I do not currently have a job so I cannot support myself. I cannot even explain how frustrated I am. I fear that if she takes away my laptop, not only will I lose contact with my only friends but I won't be able to write anymore(something that I've done for nine years). I've definitely thought about suicide again, however my friends and my father makes me push away that. But I admit the thought of never having to see my mother again or listen to her put me down makes me feel so good.

At this point I feel nothing for her. She could literally have a heart attack and I won't care. Why should I? She's never been there for me. She's never causes me any sort of happiness, in fact she's a big reason why I've wanted to kill myself. According to her I'm always in the wrong, me me me. And I'm so tired. I'm mentally exhausted and I just want to go away forever to a place where I don't have to worry about things any longer. I don't even know what a mother's love feels like and I really want to. I want her out of my life and I want it asap. 

Please help me, anyone. I don't know what else I have to do. ",suicide
205511,"I think today is the day.For various reasons, ever since two weeks ago I have intended to actually kill myself. I mean I had always been open to the idea that if things got too hairy I could just scotch myself my entire life but I never contemplated actual suicide up until then. Last Friday was that day I was going to do it, but I changed my mind and though that I could still live life, but recently I have changed my mind. I saw my therapist last night and I was actually feeling very good and had no intention of doing so (although even after I decided not to, it has been lurking in the back of my head as a safety net). My mother found my note the day after I changed my mind while rummaging through my room and told my therapist. I clarified that I didn't want to kill myself anymore, but he told me to call him if I was thinking about it again. If I wanted to kill myself why would I call someone who would try to convince me to not do so, although I suppose thats what I am doing now (by sharing with you).",suicide
205512,"I think I will kill myself at the end of the summer.I'm not sure where to begin.

I'm turning 20 in a few weeks and I see no point in going on, no plan or hope for the future.

At the beginning of the year I dropped out of school because the industry I was working on had an incredibly sexist environment that made it difficult for me to feel enthused about my career or even come to school. Between the sexual harassment and being put down by my peers, I had to get out of there. So I left, and applied to art school because I've always enjoyed doing art and people tell me I'm good at it. I got in to one of the top-ranked art schools and will be starting there in the fall. But I don't want to go anymore. It's incredibly expensive, and since I am an orphan (mom cut contact, dad passed away) I have no financial support. I also think art school is kind of stupid now. Of course you can improve as an artist, but you have to be born a truly great artist. It can't be taught. And I wasn't born a great artist. Art doesn't make me happy anymore. Nothing else does though, and I'm too stupid to really do anything else. It hurts me to admit it but sometimes I even struggle with basic multiplication, so there's no way I could pass a math class. People always say I'll find something I like when I get there, but it's an ART school. All they teach is art. And people also say ""you're young! you can try whatever you want to do!"" but that costs money, and financially I am running out of time. 

There's so much pressure on my generation to find a passion, but I don't feel strongly about doing anything. I want to sit and bed and do nothing.

I don't know what sort of mental state someone has to be in to kill themselves and I guess I'm curious if I'm idealizing a concept or I'm actually pretty close to the edge.

I'm on the 7th grade 3rd semester currently I have no classes til the 22nd. This online school thing took a toll on me and my grades it took a toll on my mental health and the way I think as well. This whole thing sucks. I was one of the top students on my last school, I always submitted my work on time and get great grades but recently I noticed that has changed I started putting of certain assignments I started procrastinating I started to sleep less and the list goes on. So For 7th grade I moved to a math snd science school and this school is known for raising smart and elite students.

I have left over work from the 1st and 2nd semester so now everything is piling up on me and now I'm stressed and under pressure, My parents have high expectations from me and they're really strict so not much I can do. Aside from this online school setup I have also been struggling to find motivation, this is one of the main reasons I started not doing certain assignments. I simply don't see the point in going on when some people my age make mountains of cash by doing youtube or streaming.

Right now I'm on welbutrin and lamictal and I still have no energy, ability to focus, memory issues, and a burning desire for nothing more than to catch the bus.

I live alone and sometimes occasionally call my dad or sister. I have a good handful of friends in the city I live in, everyone knows me as smiling and happy. I try confiding in family about issues and they shut me out every time, but I do have a therapist I see once a week. I grew up with a BPD alcoholic mom so we are nc. I got kicked out at 16, moved into a homeless shelter then with my abusive ex. Then I got pregnant when I was 18 and gave the baby for adoption, which I still fucking regret. I wish I had my shit together and could care for him, but I was a mentally ill kid who could barely take care of himself.

My executive functioning is garbage, I can barely take care of mundane chores and my self. My last couple jobs only lasted a couple months each last year, and I have the desire to have a long term job again and feel stable but it doesn't feel possible when I can't even take care of dishes. I have trust issues and I'm really paranoid that people all have a goal of using me or hurting me in some way. I really have no supports or help besides government paying my bills and a therapist letting me spill my guts to her, as everyone else just wants the happy and smiling fake version of me.

I just feel like a constant disappointment. Like a waste of government resources for them to pay for the living costs of someone who doesn't even want to live. I have the opportunity to get an education for free, have my living costs paid for, I should be psyched like any other person in their early 20s. It all just seems like waaay too much work. I'm just going to fail like every other attempt I've had at going back to school.  I don't have the energy to start all these things just to end up dropping it all again and hating myself even more for failing again. 

I'm very obese (310lbs) and it should be easy for me to start losing weight because I have such a high tdee. I've done a lot of reading about CICO and n how to start losing weight but I'm weak and buy fast food almost daily. I can't stop emotionally eating and feeling self-loathing afterward. 

I also have just over $1000 of financial debt that's been tagging along for almost a year and a half. I really don't feel like I'm capable of maintaining anything, let alone improving myself. Having most of everything written out helps put things into perspective for me at least, I really don't want to continue living everyday with the heavy guilt and self-hatred.

I'm a 27 year old with bipolar I with mixed episodes. Some of the meds I take destroy me and make it so I can't get through the day. This isn't a cry for help; It's just facts being stated. I feel I need to get them out. I'll be transferring all my money in to my family's accounts. I'm playing with my dog a lot so she can still get at least a little out of me before I go. I've cleaned my house, removed everything embarrassing from my belongings. I've sorted out all the books I'd like them to read. After some more cleaning and saying good bye to people without letting on that I'll be dead in three days.
    
I've written up a list of how I want my body destroyed. I don't know if anyone cares other than my dog. I'll be leaving a hastily written note before I go out.
    
I don't see the value in my life anymore. It's mostly the bipolar but there are straight facts that make my life worth living. I don't care for anyone but my family reading my note.    
I'm betting you guys are used to this nonsense, but I feel at least a little of my story should be told.    
I've been diagnosed with Bipolar I and there is no medication that can cure or at least treat me. I feel like a robot, putting things of mine out of the way before I'm found. BP1 entails manic-depressive label most people do label us with. I have my mixed episodes of being depressed, delusional, happy, ecstatic, a retching sensation and no one understands. People I talk to don't get it. Even people I've talked to on reddit about this stuff don't seem to get my demons.    
It feels like a black core at the center of my torso. Nothing seems worth it. I don't date. I don't have anything I actually enjoy doing these days, on the computer or otherwise. I'm a useless waste of space with a menial job and no hopes or dreams of the future.    
What the fuck is the point?
    
Three days. Heroin overdose. Please don't judge me, or even understand what I'm going through. I just needed to tell SOMEONE since I've not a single friend.

I've nothing to offer. No skills to give me some sort of meaning. I don't even read anymore, and reading used to be one of the ONLY things in my life, full stop.

205552,"I relapsedHey, lemme know if I need to flair/tag this with something 

It sucks, but I relapsed again. Its never been bad before but this time its really worse. I never felt safe in my own home because of my dad and his girlfriend. His girlfriend is literally ruining my family. My siblings are at their limits. I don't know what to do anymore. My family is breaking apart. I don't do anything or say anything to my dad because we all want him to happy. I know he doesn't want to be alone after my mom passed away. We all don't want my dad to feel like that. But Jesus, this woman he picked is literally toxic as hell. I asked for one holiday (Thanksgiving) with just my family, no boyfriends/girlfriends around and she gets all mad and petty at me. Their anniversary is this Christmas and my sister tells me that she said that there's no exceptions, they're spending their time together alone. My dad has changed,  I barely recognize him anymore. He always tends to his girlfriend's needs. I understand that my siblings and I are grown, but damn man,, I just want my dad around. He's the only parent I have left in this world. I don't want to lose him too.

Everything she's doing and the atmosphere in the house is killing me. I tried to be better and take care of my health and mental health but today just was the last straw. Yeah I thought about ending myself, but I'm just to chicken to do it. My sister tells me to hang on and that in 2 months it'll be better but I really don't know if I can hang on for that long. Its awful. My family never used to be like this, and I know its all because of her. She used to be married and that didn't end well. Her ex husband and his nephew (my brother's friend) know she's a bad person. I don't wanna type anymore about her,  she's giving me more anxiety tbh lol.

Anyways, I'm trying to stay strong but its hard. Thoughts of ending myself are coming back, my anxiety attacks are back and more worse. I feel weak and so sick. I don't have energy to do things anymore. I do wish things were better. Hopefully soon.",suicide

205566,"What are some memories where you are deeply ashamed of? Hey everyone!

I'm a student filmmaker from Belgium and for an upcoming shortfilm I am looking for some inspiration. 

I remember when I was a teen (especially when I was around 12-14 years old) there were moments that I really felt 'left out' and did not have many friends. Reason of this was going to a highschool in another town and not knowing anybody. I was very insecure but at the same time I had the feeling that starting with a clean slate gave me the oppurtunity to be someone totally new and cool. 

But ofcourse, nobody really fell for that...

 I started realizing that my classmates could be really cruel sometimes and later on I realized that *I* could be cruel too. 

Now that I'm older. Those memories sometimes hit me really hard. I remember myself bulying other people, hoping that the populair kids would find me funny and cool and accept me in their group even though I didn't really like them. 

As a kid I just wanted to be loved and that the other kids would look up to me. But it al spiraled down in a way where I was making *other* kids feel bad because other kids were making *me* feel bad. 

I kind of noticed that as a kid you don't even think about the consequences, your sense of right and wrong is just not as strong as it (hopefully) is when you get older. So in a way, we can't really blame or younger selves. But still I feel ashamed. Ashamed of the things I have done to other people, ashamed of the embarassing situations I have been in because of other people but also myself. 

It's the kind of shame that feels like it grabs my throat and it makes me feel horrible.

But that's the kind of feeling, the emotion that I want to translate in my new shortfilm.

*Long story short: I'm looking for stories from you guys from around the age of 11-14. Maybe a memorie of you doing something where you are now very ashamed of. Or something painful that happened to you by someone else.*

I'm not looking for over the top and sensational bully-stories. I'm more interested in the stories that get under your skin. For example: I had a girl in my class who was very populair. She was very smart in a way that she knew exactly how to get under someones skin and not getting caught by just asking me simple questions that caught me of guard like: 'Why are you wearing that?', 'Who's wearing that smelly deodorant?','What happened to your hair?'...  Those kind of questions made me feel horrible but teachers never took the situation serious because she was just asking questions and they didn't see the harm of it. 

Now I want to make a film about those situations. I hope you guys don't think I'm generalizing. I'm very aware of the fact that every kid, every school and every community is different. I went to high school in Belgium and am now 22, so a lot has changed, situations are different everywhere and NOT every kid or every teen did mean, cruel or unethical things. 

But if you did or remember something happening to you, please let me know. I'm not here to judge you, my purpose is kind of the opposite. I'm trying to understand why we maybe did something like that and make a humanizing film out of it where I try to enlighten both sides of a story :)

You want to die when you try to sleep

You want to die when you work

You want to die when you exercise

You want to die when you shower

You want to die when you are on your phone


Sure, sometimes I get focused on the present and forget it about because I’m in the moment but obviously soon enough the though comes again.

I wonder every night if the next morning the thought would stop coming to me like magic but of course the very moment I wake up the thought pops into my head as if it was my daily ritual.

It’s not like the current situation is hard for me. The only thing that’s hard for me is that I can’t get my thoughts to come true. Either I have to get my thoughts into action or have my thoughts be gone. Tried twice already and it didn’t work. Wasn’t able to do it to myself. I don’t know if I was afraid of being suffocated for a several minutes. Maybe a gunshot would have been easier.

But with the country I am in, that’s not possible.

I’m sick of therapy. I’m sick of the same tests that I took for the last few years. I’m sick of talking to strangers that have to encounter me just because it’s their job.

Life is just boring. Used to like gaming, used to like technology. It’s not that I don’t do those stuff anymore, but they don’t interest me anymore and the only reason I do them is because I’ve done it before and those are the things that I know about. Current me is merely a remnant of the past.

Used to be very curious. Now nothing really intrigues me anymore. Miss my old past self but he’s gone now.

205623,"Can't have knives at my place anymore. Sorry for the vent, this weekend was rough. (xpost from r/depression)My state of mind has been all over the place. I had a really scary night on Friday, I had an overwhelming urge to stick a knife in my chest. I'm no stranger to suicidal thoughts, but it's never been this strong or violent before.

&amp;nbsp;

It got to the point where I wanted to get rid of all my kitchen knives, but was too scared to go anywhere near them. It was terrifying, I had to get out of there. I spent the night at my boyfriend's place. He knew something was up (I was a wreck, and he was out with friends when I texted him) but I told him I just wasn't feeling well and didn't want to be alone.

&amp;nbsp;

I spent most of the weekend either with him or blazed out of my mind watching movies and playing video games and checking my phone at the same time to keep myself distracted, which honestly worked pretty well. I didn't think about suicide unless I was by myself and slowed down or got too sober.

&amp;nbsp;

Leading up to this I was really dreading going to a party I was invited to Friday night, and also possibly going out of town to visit my sisters Saturday. Saying ""dread"" doesn't really do it justice, there was a point where I felt like would literally rather die than go. The last thing I wanted was to be seen, and I knew they would want to go out to a club and get all glammed up and take lots of pictures.

&amp;nbsp;

I have zero clothes for that sort of thing, my wardrobe is pretty much the same as when I was on a barista budget, I look and feel super awkward in pictures like that, and I've been losing more and more hair (from stress I guess? had bloodwork done and there weren't abnormalities). I'm down to less than half of what I used to have, clumps come out every time I shower or touch my hair.

&amp;nbsp;

My sisters both look incredible, their selfie game is on point, they're both in super good shape, and have a great sense of style, confidence, etc... I just didn't want to be the awkward bummed girl bringing everyone down. If by some miracle I had made it there, playing along would have felt like torture and would have taken absolutely everything I had.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the most disturbing parts of this was feeling *good* less than 24 hours after all this. I mean, I was working hard to distract myself from those thoughts and was high as a kite, but it still doesn't make any damn sense. Sobbing and panicking because I felt like I *needed* to stab myself, then laughing and joking with my boyfriend the next day made me feel even more insane.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm at work this morning and I feel safe, I don't have the urge anymore. I just feel like a psycho for being able to be all bubbly with my coworkers after the weekend I had. It feels automatic, I sit up straight and this big smile takes over my face as soon as anyone comes over to my cube, and then the moment they leave I instantly go back to slouchy neutral/exhausted zombie mode.

&amp;nbsp;

It feels gross and inauthentic, but it's the norm for me here and I'd rather feel this way than have to think of a blatant lie to tell people that explains why I'm not my normal cheerful self. I honestly don't know if I could control it enough to switch it ""off"" anyways.

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry for the wall of text. Just had to get this out. I am getting help, I have a great psychologist and I'm trying *another* fucking kind of medication with a new psychiatrist. Just got a new diagnosis of being Cycolthymic (like bipoler lite?) instead of just Chronic Depression and General Anxiety Disorder. Fun fun.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Going from wanting to stab yourself in the chest to feeling okay is exhausting. If you feel or have felt anything like this, my hat's off to you. This is the f*cking worst, and you're a badass for still being alive.

205624,"Been thinking about it for a while...My family doesn’t support me. Financially is fine- I have a roof over my head, and then some- but emotionally not so much.

My mother always cuts me off from a subject that's important to me to say “oh your eyebrows are a little off”, “your hair's a mess! (and by mess she means a single strand of hair.) I came out to her wanting to transition from female to male a few months ago (after feeling such a way for 6 years), and she assumed I was genderfluid, and I never heard her speak of it again. In turn, I assume that she doesn’t want me to transition, causing me to pretend to be cisgender female, which makes her think that I lied. I am also pansexual, and nonreligious, but considering her reaction to my gender identity, I’ve been afraid to tell her. Because of this, I’ve had severe anxiety for the last 6 years, to  the point where I cannot read sometimes, causing me to fail one class (I’m a straight A student), and she acted as if it were the end of the world. She also yells at me when I’m anxious, and a few hours later acted as if she didn’t know, and even goes so far as to say her anxiety is worse than my own. I am not one to judge, but my mother isn’t the one breaking down in a crowded store.

My dad can’t help it on his hand. Having brain injuries and PTSD, he says a lot of things he doesn’t mean. Sometimes, he doesn’t remember it at all, or even thinks he said something else. However, he thinks my anxiety is baseless, and I have no reason to be. I don’t want to be anxious, but he treats me as the villain for having it. He is very anxious himself (kinda a package deal with PTSD), but I don’t understand why he doesn’t understand this.

My two-years-younger sister, who I’ve always protected and stuck my neck out for, couldn’t give half a shit. I try to talk to her, and she gives me a withering glare and is incredibly impatient for something that will literally take just a minute of her precious time, impatience even turning to anger if she’s using something electronic. I know I never did this to her, even when playing games. She assumes I don’t listen to her now, and because of that we’ve been fighting more. I asked for her, once, to say that I bought something for her (which I did) to my parents so I wouldn’t get in trouble, and she told me “deal with my own problems.” Which I do, and then help her with her problems. She just hates me at this point.

Now, I’ve been wanting to kill myself for the last year. The only thing that’s making me live is my dog, the only one that cheers and supports me when I cry or am anxious. My family treat him like shit too. I have no friends, and am not dating anyone since I broke up with my boyfriend, afraid to come out to someone who was born and raised in the homophobic town I live in (not helped at all by the neighboring base, where stereotypical feminine and masculine roles are hyper generalized. It’s looked down upon if a man’s wife is a marine, and he is not as well.)

I can’t deal with this problem anymore, and if someone doesn’t help me soon, I don’t know what I’ll do during my next anxiety attack. Note, that I am 18, and while I can move out and transition on my own, I don’t want to leave my family, despite what they have done, and continue to do to me. I’ve been trans (mentally, unable to transition due to homophobic town and being a minor at the time) for six years, my religious stance being known for seven, and my sexuality known for four. My only escape is my dog, and video games which I have not had much time for it due to a busy college schedule.

205640,"Today I feel really sadIt's been a wild rollercoaster of events lately, and it's been hard to handle, from my family and life itself making life really unbearable and hard to live, to losing the one and only reason that I've lived for and pushed so far, the person I love. It's hard to fight these suicidal thoughts, and sometimes I really lose will to live, and it's been getting more and more difficult to fight the feeling, the thoughts, and especially the pain of losing you. Recently we made up and agreed to start again, from zero, but it hurts acting so differently and I'm so impatient for us to go back the way we were. You cannot even tell me that you love me, you feel it's too intense at the moment and you barely reply to my messages. I write you lines and lines of text, but you reply as if I didn't even write anything. I just don't know how to react, or what to say. I send you voice messages, but I honestly don't even know if you really listen to them. It's painful to not be able to be by your side, to not be able to hear your voice, to make you happy and know what's on your mind, to not have you say that you love me. Maybe I've been moving too fast, ever since we agreed to start again. I say too much, I express my feelings too much. But how can I not when I love you, and love isn't just expressed in the romantic way, love is being dedicated to you, caring for you and wanting your best more than anything in this world. You're my everything, and I love you so much, you've no idea. But I don't know how to react to what's going on, and it's painful, but I'll do my best to continue being understanding, though it hurts, you still make me just as happy, even if right now it's by thought, since we didn't even talk yesterday. You're my reason to keep going, and I owe it to you last week wasn't my last week. I love you .",suicide
205642,"Logical SuicideHere we go. I've been thinking about suicide for most of my teenage and adult life, and am now in my mid 30s. As a teenager I made some attempts and failed. The reasons back then were different, but are still somewhat a factor now because they have evolved into different situations.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't say I'm in danger of doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or even next week. Maybe in the next year though. I create goals for myself to complete in order to delay the suicidal thoughts, because I feel like if I accomplish that goal maybe everything will finally come together. The problem is that it never does.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to make a long story short. I was raised in a very dysfunctional family where there was alcoholism and physical/emotional abuse, the middle child of three. Every day of childhood was a war, with endless yelling and violence, though the parents never attacked each other physically, just their children. Money was scarce, largely due to alcohol costing money and also leading to bad decisions or delays in maintaining responsibilities. Money being scarce meant no chance of social success at school. I was also not allowed to do anything with friends, due to my mother being paranoid and overbearing. This situation led me to my first attempts at suicide between the ages of 15 and 16. It led to me being unable to complete highschool on time, though I finally managed to complete it by 20. I was severely depressed back then. I went to psychologists, and psychiatrists, and I went through the medication gauntlet, but nothing really worked because it was not a chemical problem, it was a lifestyle problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally made some major progress thanks to taking a very high dose of mushrooms one night and having a monumental perspective shift. I was not a substance user, but decided to say ""fuck it"" that night and take the risk. A few days after that, the 180 degree shift started and I found a job, and started saving money to move out on my own. I did it, and then put myself through school. Throughout this time I was always suicidal, but I had logic on my side and knew I could simply follow certain guidelines to have a better life. This always turned out to be the case. I graduated at the top of my class. I got high paying jobs while still in school, and afterwards. Nobody even knew I was suicidal at this time, because life was so good, and I became a success story in my impoverished hometown.

&amp;#x200B;

My love life was never great. I'm not an ugly guy, but I'm not really attractive either, I'm just somewhere in the middle. Women never threw themselves at me, but if I tried I could get a few numbers based on my personality and being in pretty good physical fitness. All of my relationships have been with abusive women. I believe this is because of my subconscious mind looking for its comfort zone, which is abuse in my case due to my upbringing. However I have not really found a solution to this problem, so I largely gave up on dating years ago. I'm pretty much clueless as to how to move forward here, if at all. I really don't want to go through the pain of a failed relationship again, and I don't know how to have a healthy one, so I settled on not having one at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I was successful in my career and smart with my money. I burned out at my last job, and realized I needed to quit when I started thinking about jumping in front of the train in the morning instead of going back to the office. So then I quit and bought myself a one-way plane ticket to another country. I wandered around for awhile crossing borders every so often and finding myself in the most random of places without a plan. I tired of this and returned to my home country, only to go back to school to get an even better education. This is a delay tactic, an attempt to put another goal on the table for me to complete so that I'm distracted from the real questions for awhile.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am now. I am once again at the top of my class, with very little time left to go before I'm finished. I'm paying out of pocket again, but this time I have a large supply of cash and few legitimate concerns from a logical standpoint. But something is still wrong. When I graduate for a second time, I will have no goals left on the table. I don't want to just go back to my old life, working at an office for 8+ hours per day and coming back to an empty home for another 30 years. I have no family support because my parents are still drinking heavily and both have a foot in the grave. One of my siblings is extremely abusive and disrespectful, and the other left the country many years ago to escape the situation I've described. Relationships don't seem to be a realistic possibility. Most of my old friends are deteriorating into their own substance abuse situations, which seems to be very common for people from small impoverished towns as they age. New friends are harder to make as you age. I am reluctant to get a dog because it's a huge responsibility that I may not be able to fulfill if my mental state deteriorates.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is why I call this logical suicide. I don't feel depressed, or sad. I just add everything up and don't really see much room for change. I can continue on like this, but there's no source of joy or happiness in any of it. I just continue to exist, continuing to repeat this cycle endlessly until the day of my natural death. This is why I think about suicide nowadays. It's because I don't feel like waiting around anymore. Maybe there is truly no logic in any of this thinking, but you need a little bit of comedy I suppose. If I do it in the next year I'll be leaving a bunch of cash behind, which is the strangest part of it. Money doesn't really make you happy or solve any of the real problems after all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just putting this out there to see if anyone has any advice at all or at least can empathize.",suicide
205643,"Life is a funny thingOften times people treat it as a blessing, as if it were the most important thing. But, why is it that so many people suffer? And that so many people decide to turn a blind eye? Humanity's crude morals are abhorrent. I really, really hate this world. Life isn't a blessing, it is the worst thing that's happened to so many of us.  


Today, I thought - Why should I not just go for it? What is stopping me? People have already proven that they don't care, even if I say out right that for years I have detested myself so much that I was willing to permanently end things. They say ""Talk to us if you need to"" ""I'm always here for you"" ""You're not alone"" ""Things will get better"".  


Surely, most of you must have heard these phrases before. I've come to learn that they are not genuine offers, but rather humble manners to preserve good self image. What I fool I was to trust such words. ""You can talk to me if you want"", yet I am called an attention seeker by the same person who offered to hear about the feelings I have tried to bottle up for so long.  


Even if my family or friends care - for how long? A month? Maybe two if I am lucky? And then, they will forget about it. I have never been a remarkable person after all.   


The only problem is how exactly to carry it out. I am just a kid, it is not like I could possibly do something like buy cyanide or enough pills for an overdose. Not to mention, I am in England. I cannot just go down to the garage and nab my father's gun to do the job, no.

She doesn't want me going to a man's house. Because he hasn't been with a woman for months, and he might be a pervert. She also asked me if I was dating him!! Like bruh, no. He's gay and I rather date a girl. My age too!!! Like seriously. Is she dumb? But I can't tell her that he's gay because then she will be like, you can't hangout with her anymore. Now I know where you get these crazy ideas from. Because one time I talked about the difference between sexual and romantic attraction. But that was a bad idea. But you know what was even worse? I told her I wasn't religious and then I got grounded. Lolll. But that was a while ago. Anyways what do you think? Should I tell her? I don't want to offend her or her dad because they're both amazing people! Also if I tell her she might tell her dad or someone else. And then my mom would probably find out and then I would die.

I think about my best friend all the time and worry about her constantly. For her and my parents and pretty much everyone I tend to worry about car accidents because I think that's the most common way to die. I'm especially afraid of my mom dying, she's one of my best friends. 


Besides that I worry about animals dying too, like my cat and my dog. I love my dog to death but he is a dumbass who runs after cars when he sees them (yet he won't go near water) and that's just a recipe for a dog dying. And my cat is usually outside and I always worry that she'll get in a fight with an animal and die. Or that some asshole will hit her with their car. That happened to my kitten when I was 10. I just saw a picture of a cute dog all happy with a bunch of people around and I just thought ""what if someone shot him or threw things at him or something?"" 


It just goes on and on and on. I have loads of family members I worry about on a daily basis. It's a fucking nightmare that I can't wake up from because I always see horrible images in my head of my loved ones dead bodies, and I see myself standing around their casket at their funeral and bawling my eyes out at the hospital and think of the ways I'd kill myself if it ever happened. 


I want to die so so so bad, I don't want to live with these thoughts anymore, I don't want to think these things, I just want to drink and take pills and smoke. not to die. Just enough to make the thoughts go away. I'm so scared every day. I can't fucking live this way but I have to because I'm not going to kill myself no matter how badly I want to. I don't want to put anyone through what I'm horrified of going through. Besides, I'm too scared anyway.

I just have been accumulating this feeling for a month now and I feel like breaking apart... I wish I could tell him this things, but I know it would make him upset... 



I have a brother, my older brother who suffers from chronic depression. I also suffer it, but somehow, I am less affected than him.

Due to work I had to move out recently, and since then, I have not been able to sleep well, you see... My brother has treated to self harm himself multiple times, he even disappeared once, and he refuses to get treatment. I was the only one he would talk to at home, but now that I am gone... Who is going to talk to him? 

I am scared all nights and all days... I am scared that I wont see him anymore the next time I travel home and breaks my heart. 

Is funny, how we always end up fighting, how he hates that i put my feet on the front of the car and I hate his short temper. How I have had to adjust my taste to his so I have something to talk about with him... Does he notices that? That I try hard? 

Does he notices that I love him? That I admire him? That I wish I was the sick one and not him, he has always been the smartest, the one that everybody admires... Including me, I have always been so proud of my big brother. Instead i have always been so dumb, so stupid, so useless... If it was me it would not be a waste. 

Does he notices that I am sorry that sometimes I loose my temper with him? That I feel that he has just been lying all this time? That he fooled my mother and I and he truly loves us? 

Does he notices how our mother craves one of his hugs and kisses? That she always mentions it? ....brother... Do you notice  That she is scared to loose you?

Did you liked that I called you today? Sorry that I broke in tears... But at least you seemed worried, I liked that. I truly did. I told you I missed you, but you did not told me a thing... i hope you miss me too. 

I wish you could speak to me more often, or invite me to something you like, instead to feel like I keep pushing myself on you... 

I cant wait to go on saturday... I know you would not like that I hugged you, but I want you to know, that I really do miss you. I have been crying all nights, today has been the worst... I have been thinking that Maybe if I didnt exist you would have been happier. If I die... Would you miss me? 

Please brother, smile a bit, is all I want. I am worried for you so much... Please brother take care of yourself.

205681,Here's a funny joke! My French teacher said that they opened up the schools to boost our mental health. I'm dying of laughter. Imagine- imagine-  Stressing kids out when they have no way to output it.... ***TO HELP THEM!***,non-suicide
205682,"This may be my last year or two on earth. Right when I see what’s really important it’s too late. I wish I would’ve seen it sooner.I might be on my way out. Either this year or the next. If my fate ends up on the worse end of the spectrum and my emotions get the best of me this year then it’ll be this year. If not, I’ll write my memoir and then i go out. I have hopes of this becoming a screen play, because it’ll be acted out accordingly. It may not be the first if it’s kind but it will spoken about for at least a year. My life after 26 has been for the most part, horrible. I made the dumb decision of having a child with a single mother who was definitely not for me and from that point in my life has been a living hell. Everything I held dear vanished in front of me. Family, friends, ohhh and let’s not forget that money. Not only was I super naive, I let that lead me into the lair of deceit so confusing, by the time I realized what it was it was too late. Now don’t get me wrong, my child is wonderful and I love them but their mom is not so wonderful. I’m not gonna sit here and say that I’m perfect; but I’ll never curse him for being here. Why is it that after the fact we understand? Hindsight is always 20/20. They say that behind every strong man is a strong woman. These days im starting to believe that saying more and more. Even though with these words I may sound weak to some. And it’s not just for men; because if a strong woman has a strong man behind her or in front of her, then she’ll benefit as well. If you have a toxic and childish spouse with more baggage than cargo space, it’ll drag you down; believe me. And it’ll be your fault for allowing that mess into your path. I regret it everyday, every second, every waking moment. I wish my child had a better mom. And maybe after reading this some of you may think they deserves a better father; well so what. I won’t be here anyways to challenge that opinion so keep it. I’ve made some grave mistakes in my life and ironically they’ve led me to my grave faster than I can ever imagine. There’s no excuse that would be accepted; but it might be understood. I’m human. I took on a challenge that I could no longer bare and I was being sucked dry. All my resources all of my energy; and for what? An attitude, ungratefulness, leeching, callousness, petty jealousy, non-reciprocity. When I actually started to put my foot down, I might as well have been throwing the boulder up a hill so it could roll back down onto my back. I should’ve left when I had the chance. Looking at my life from those first moments, I cry at how ignorant I was and how I thought I knew so much, pushing away my family who tried to guide me. I let insecurities push me into being recklessness which led me down a darker path. A path I’ve become bitter rivals with. A path that has thrown nothing but suffering my way and it was of my own doing. I’m so ashamed. The last act of selfishness I did for my own sanity and to move on is why I’m speaking on this platform today. However this turns out, I know I could’ve lived life differently and more productively. If I was given the chance I’d take it this time but something tells me that I’ve used all the chances I can. There’s nothing left for me depending on the culmination of this year. I’ve never listened to my gut before but in this case it’s telling me it’s over for me. So it’s either a big exit this year or next year with a crescendo build up. I know i sound crazy, but I brought myself here. It’s my fault. I wish it was just a bad dream I could wake up from but it’s not. I can’t pinch myself enough.",suicide

So yeah, here goes my short biography.
I've never been liked in general by other kids™, I've spend my childhood alone, with parents yelling at each other at home and they was divorced when I was 10, with over sensitive, mellow mother and callous father. Ofc I was bullied, I've spent few nights crying, I've been having some psychological problems kid of shit and started going to therapists(they're ll was meh) when I invited other kids at my birthday party having some hope that someone will come only 3 of them out of 15 arrived, and gave me some cheap, shitty presents, and I stopped caring about social shit when I hit 12.
I was always having problems to relate to others, to understand what they feel. I knew why the're feeling that, but I was cold as stone from the beginning. So, when I hit 12 I started to stop caring about my grades, I don't studied, tbh I never liked to study, to listen that borning shit and doing equaly borning notes. Anyway I still managed to get to higher classes on the lowest grades possible. Teachers tried to motivate me, wasn't working. Some of them said that I was inteligent and have great imagination™, but I was not interested in it. I wasn't interested at anything.
When I hit 14 hatred started consuming me, and as I was getting older it was getting stronger, then bloodlust joined, mostly taking over me.
I've spent 4 next years pretending to be caring and kind person, and it worked for everyone but my mother who was my personal ,,punching bag"".(I wasn't reffering to physical violence, but the psychological one, the shitton of it, making my poor mother crying at nights and feeding on it with zero guilt)

I don't care about people, I don't care about my social image when NOBODY teached me how to live in society, I can't make connections with people, but I will do anything to turn your life into hell and get what I want.
And here I am now, an asocial and antisocial fuck with no perspectives on future, good day/nigh and whatevyr™.
Damn, I think that sounds pretty edgy, I am right?

205688,"It's BackHey everyone,

So, I'm going through a tough time emotionally and I'm really pretty fragile. The TL;DR version is that I lost control of myself and now I'm feeling pretty unlovable, monstrous and self-loathing. I've been in this place before (the last time resulted in some pretty severe self-harm) and since the last ""incident"" I've been able to keep a tighter control on myself. Anyway, things are slipping now and while I'm not feeling suicidal at present, I'm beginning to have pervasive thoughts. Disturbing mental imagery and when I let my mind wander or allow my thoughts to just drift without direction I find myself beginning to make a plan. I guess I'm here because I don't want to fall back to the bottom or reach a point where I feel hopeless. Does any of this make sense to anyone?

205693,"I feel it in my gut that im going to meet my endI know and am sure that everything from this point on in my life is going to be worthless and monotonous. Last year I made the dumb decision to quit my job that I was good at and liked. For the next 6 months, I had a psychotic break and did some crazy shit like slice open my skin and paint the walls. I tried ripping into areas where my arteries are with a box knife. I have a new job now, one that I hate every second of. Unfortunately it took 8 months for me to even be hired as a pathetic dishwasher. I blame this on my social anxiety and my face. I'm a female but I have hereditary alopecia and struggle with acne on top of having a slight deformity to my face due to what I think has been high levels of male hormones during development. I will never be able to date because of this and the subsequent social phobia. Social anxiety is probably the main culprit of my unhappiness. It always has been. I've tried very hard to overcome it especially in the last 7 years, but it's only gotten worse with age. Almost anything I tried to do backfired big time. Sometimes I wonder why I can never have a positive social interaction even when it's not my fault at all. 
I'm tired of talking and talking about it and sounding like the boy who cried wolf. I just have to make it a goal somehow. I'm at a point where being dead doesn't scare me as much as before. It's just blacking out forever and I'm fine with that now. ",suicide

i have an appointment with a psychologist next week, but i can't feel like i'm ever gonna get better. truth is, i kinda feel like i like feeling like this, like this is my 'safe space' and anything out of it is just scary and unreachable, i don't know. i don't even know why i'm writing this, honestly.

205696,"Does anyone else have these few things in life that prevent you from killing yourself?For me that's beautiful moments with cool people, that I mostly always end up not having contact with anymore, so that's like a few times a year if at all, playing the drums and listening to music, playing with a band. And lastly watching movies and series' playing video games, I just started Dragon Quest 11, and I just don't want to not use the opportunity to play all these amazing stories and being invested in these storylines and playing new amazing games, that I wouldn't even know about. 
On the other side are my parents, who raised me to be an incompetent fuck when it comes to actual physical work, my father being a highly nicotine addicted sociopath, who screamed at my mom and especially me ever since I was like 7 or 8, and my mom, who I always liked, who is now pissed about everything and screams at me and my sister about every little thing we say and do, my sister especially screaming back and my father often joining in too, so while I am avoiding screaming back and forth with my family members within my possibilities, I still have to listen to this shit every day. I also struggle at school, not being liked by a lot of teachers and other students, and also don't really have the motivation to work, often also thinking in class or when having to do homework or Learning for a test that I'll hopefully be ready to kill myself when I have my Finals. To all of that comes a deeply rooted porn addiction, that started when I was a young child already, which is not really the cause of my problems, but by dependence of it makes it way harder to cope with it. I have battled it, and it went well often, but when I'm really low it just somehow always comes back and I think it has never been worse than it is right now. 

So theres all this bullshit to life, which I don't really expect to get better over the next decade or maybe even ever, and the little things that I don't wanna miss out on and use my opportunity for and I'm not sure weather it's worthy living for and having to hate every time you wake up for or not...",suicide
